# The market order and its reconstruction

## Economics, institutions, and the possibility of alternative institutional forms of the market economy

**Rodrik**

* Do contemporary market economies depend on a particular form of institutions?
* Institutions are the “rules of the game in a society”
	* Formal: law, regulations
	* Informal: norms, patterns, moral codes
	* Not organizations in the sense that they don’t need a physical form
* A functional typology of market-supporting institutions:
	* Market-creating: property rights, contract enforcement
	* Market-regulating: antitrust, environment/safety regulations, labor market institutions, “industrial policies” = correction of market/coordination failure
	* Market-stabilizing: monetary, fiscal, currency arrangements = macroeconomic management
	* Market-legitimizing: redistribution, social insurance, political democracy
* Don’t want to mistakenly associate these functions with forms: there’s no unique mapping between the two because of local specificity
	* Ex: macroeconomic stability doesn’t necessarily imply independent central banks
* We have an objective like productive efficiency (static and dynamic)
	* That implies certain universal principles: property rights, incentives, the rule of law
	* But not particular arrangements: what type of property rights? Is there a role for industrial policy?
* Economics can elaborate the link between these universal principles and institutional arrangements

**Unger**

* Institutions are norms, rules, and standards that govern practice in a particular dimension of social life, informed by concepts of what those relations can and should be like in that domain
* Importantly, they are not things. This distinction means:
	* The arrangements are mediated by representations (ideas) about what the relations can and should be like
		* Law is the institutional form of the life of the people
	* They tilt the scale of experience in a particular direction
		* C.f. liberal political thinking, in which the aspiration is to form a framework of rights that is neutral with respect to sectarian visions of the “good”
		* But every institutional order encourages and discourages particular forms of relations and social life
		* There is no neutral -- and this concept is dangerous because it is usually invoked in defense of entrenched ideas
		* But neutrality is the perverted (false, dangerous) form of the idea that society should be open and corrigible in the light of experience -- these are the legitimate counterparts to the idea of neutrality
	* They are artifacts in that we made them; we should thus try to understand them from the inside, not from the outside as we do natural phenomena
		* They are a kind of “frozen politics”: the ordinary struggle of politics is temporarily interrupted and contained in institutions
	* They are not univocal: they exist “more or less”
		* They can be organized to insulate themselves against challenge and change
			* Then they appear to be facts about the universe -- Marx and Hegel described them as the “alienated parts of ourselves”
		* Or we can organize them so they revise themselves
* In economics, the most important debate is about the institutional form of the market economy
	* In the 19th century, both Marxists and conservative jurists shared the belief that the market order has built-in institutional content: you buy the whole package
		* This is the Marxist conception that capitalism is a system with a predefined architecture
	* But when you try to determine the architecture of the market economy from first principles, there are choices to be made
		* The market has no single, natural, necessary legal form
		* This was the main achievement of legal theory from approx. 1850-1950, exemplified in the US by Oliver Wendell Holmes
	* This idea -- that the market doesn’t have a natural form -- can be inferred at the most abstract level. There are 2 aspects of a market order:
		* The absolute level of economic decentralization (the number of agents entitled to bargain)
		* The absoluteness of control over resources (are property rights eternal, hereditary, etc.)
			* Unified property rights are an invention of the 19th century
			* In most legal traditions, the normal form of property rights involves a disaggregation of the component parts, invested in various stakeholders
			* This control can be fragmentary, relative, limited, and temporary
	* Conservative thinking usually postulates that decentralization and control go together, but the first can be advanced by limiting the latter
* How has economics approached the problem of the institutional form of the market? In three main ways:
	* “Pure” economics: started by the marginalist theorists of the 19th century and achieved by the general equilibrium theorists of the mid-20th century
		* Free of any institutional message -- it is a form of logic, an analytical apparatus
		* Can be applied to a command economy, which implies that the choice among these systems is a political one
	* “Fundamentalist” economics: the market order does have a legal and institutional form (this is precisely the idea that the 19th-century jurists subverted)
		* Associated with ideas of Hayek: if Robinson Crusoe traded for long enough, he would reproduce the entire 19th-century system of German private law
	* “Equivocating” economics: exemplified by the American followers of Keynes who rendered his doctrines palatable by defanging them
		* Seeks to establish law-like correlations between large-scale economic aggregates, e.g. the Phillips curve
		* People challenge them by saying that these correlations depend on institutional details (like unemployment insurance or other social benefits); if the institutions change, then the correlations fall apart
			* But they can disregard these challenges by conceding the point and claiming that they are just doing analysis in the status quo
		* They confuse stability and stagnation with lawfulness
* Placing this in the context of the history of ideas:
	* Classical European social theory (Marxism) had a structural bent: to distinguish the surface from the regime that shapes routines and conflicts
	* But they surrounded this instinct with deterministic illusions that corrupted it; for example, within Marxism, the ideas that:
		* There is a closed list of basic regimes (modes of production): capitalism, feudalism, socialism, etc.
		* Each of these is a complete individual system
			* This means there are only 2 types of politics: reformist management and revolution
			* It excludes change that is structural but piecemeal
		* There are laws governing the succession of these regimes: history has a project, therefore we don’t need one
	* Contemporary social theory and policy has abolished structural ideas, which results in naturalizing the established arrangements and presenting them as the outcome of “best practice”
	* Thus, we currently have no usable idea of structural change/structural alternatives
* Addressing DR’s proposal of universal principles: they are a (mistaken) attempt to find a middle ground between “pure” economics, which is impotent, and “fundamentalist”/”equivocating” economics, which is powerful but corrupted
	* They try to take something off the table, with the idea that this is uncontroversial/everyone can agree -- but RMU doesn’t
	* Moreover, the world doesn’t. So is the world ill-advised? RMU says no
	* Example: does the goal of productive efficiency imply the rule of law and property rights?
		* The world seems to say no
		* Differential mastery of rules about property means that some groups manipulate them better than others, which leads to (sometimes violent) redistribution
		* Who will have property? And what are the benefits they get?
			* Every tax on capital is a debate about this
			* Should investors be rewarded, or stakeholders (workers) too? This is not a settled question
			* Consider the law of restitution and unjust enrichment -- should people be rewarded if they do something to enrich others, even if this wasn’t in a contract ex ante?
	* Another example: does the goal of macroeconomic and financial stability imply “sound money” policies (i.e. don’t generate liquidity in excess of money demand?)
		* The right wing disagrees with this principle: they say the only effective way to achieve this objective is to have a metallic base for money
		* This is the neoclassical synthesis: Keynesian economics downsized (macroeconomics) and superimposed on marginalist economic theory (microeconomics)
		* Progressives say the principle of sound money is a principle for a world that no longer exists
			* Today, we’re closer to the world Keynes was writing about: there are large pools of liquid capital being hoarded, underinvestment
	* Final example: does the goal of distributive justice and poverty alleviation imply targeting and universality?
		* Aren’t these principle and counter-principle? You can justify anything with this
		* The European social democrats and FDR rejected targeting in favor of universal programs; LBJ began targeting with his war on poverty
			* This turned out to be harmful for the poor because in political/economic downturns, the benefits can be turned off or downsized
		* Universality is a social compact with normative content; it should be privileged over the principle of targeting
* Five theses for thinking about alternative institutions:
	* We need to liberate ourselves from the 19th-century idea of both liberals and socialists that there is a predetermined harmony between the institutional requirements for the development of productive power (i.e. “forces of production”) and the liberation from hierarchy, especially class struggle
		* Today, we risk a dogmatic pessimism: that there is an insoluble contradiction between these things
		* But there is a zone of potential overlap in which we seek to find institutional content specific to our context
	* The focus of ideological controversy is changing: before, it was the market vs. the state, but now we need to find alternative forms of economic/social pluralism that go beyond the North Atlantic social democratic vision
	* We should have a special interest in the deepening and diffusion of the most advanced productive practice which today is the knowledge economy
		* This means promoting a high-energy democracy and an education system that allows individuals both to resist their context and operate within it
	* We want institutions that are denaturalized, not ones that resist challenge and change
		* We want structural alternatives, not a structural dogmatism
		* We want to deny our institutions the “last word”
	* We need to be attentive to a particular dialectic: we want to make the individual secure in a haven of safeguards and endowments, which we do by taking these off the table in day-to-day politics under a rhetoric of “fundamental rights”
		* But the purpose of this arrangement is to throw everything in society and economy open to change
		* The liberal discourse has the first but not the second
		* We need to figure out how to institutionally arrange for that “storm” of change
