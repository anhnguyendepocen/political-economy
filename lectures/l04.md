## The alternative futures of the knowledge economy

**Rodrik**

* Techno-optimists say the 3rd and 4th industrial revolutions are comparable to the 1st and 2nd, and that the benefits can be broadly shared with enough investment in skills
* Techno-pessimists say the scale is not comparable to the 1st and 2nd, and that its application is limited to a few sectors, which drives inequality and joblessness
* In development:
	* The optimists say that the rapid diffusion of technology aids developing countries
	* The pessimists say that skill and capital intensity and the high-quality institutions/regulations required make it hard for developing countries to catch up
* Evidence?
	* Slowdown and compartmentalization of productivity growth, gap between leading and lagging firms, widening spatial/regional divides
	* Gap between productivity and wages (especially for nonsupervisory workers)
	* Premature deindustrialization in developing countries (because of globalization and skill-intensive technical progress in manufacturing)
* Determinants of technological innovation:
	* What questions are asked and whose problems are solved -- this is what social choice is about! Technology isn’t exogenous
	* Economics: R&D costs are private but benefits are social, leads to market failure
		* Hence, innovation support: subsidies, patent protection, seed funding, etc.
	* Priorities shape support policies -- what counts as R&D, which innovations are patentable, etc.
	* Firms prefer innovations that can be monopolized, raise entry barriers, enhance control over workers, have costs/risks that can be shifted onto others
	* Unlikely to invest in innovations with social externalities
	* “High-road strategies”: technology for benefit of workers/public as opposed to pure profit/productivity
		* Is there a “win-win”? Is it in the interest of firms to have happy workers?
		* No reason to think that these incentives are universal or sufficiently strong, especially because of coordination failures
	* The internalized norm is that technological progress is synonymous with saving on labor

* Foreground theme: future of knowledge economy, which is a set of practices associated with potential that presently is suppressed
	* Division of labor: production at scale with destandardization/customization
	* Momentum in production combined with decentralization of initiative
	* Potential to relax constraint of diminishing marginal returns
	* Revolution in moral culture of production: replace low-trust command and control structure with more reciprocal trust and individual initiative
	* Make activity of producing more like activity of discovering
	* Coordination of machine and anti-machine (human being)
* Background theme: how to achieve inclusive growth?
	* Need to reckon with disappointment: we had a burst of scientific and technological development that promised exponential growth, but instead we have stagnation and inequality
* Three steps to argument:
	1. Causation of disappointment
	2. Aspects of programmatic response
	3. Level of transformative ambitions

*Causation of disappointment*

* Want to contrast 3 narratives. The first two are the most influential, and these RMU will argue against
1. Narrative of automation: technological dynamism has run away from us
	* Internal logic of technology is that it replaces labor instead of augmenting it
	* Thus, the best we can do is social compensation -- e.g. a minimum guaranteed income
	* Objection: it has never happened before that technological advances diminish employment -- this is a “lump-sum” fallacy
		* Technological evolution is indeterminate: it doesn’t have a single form, it is *shaped*
		* Whether it replaces or compensates labor depends on what we do
	* The response suggested by this narrative has no relation to the supply side of production. It doesn’t give people good jobs
2. Narrative of exhaustion: contemporary technology is inherently less fertile
	* Have we exhausted the low-hanging fruit?
	* Seems like AI, computational biology, etc. have vast potential
	* Repair to Keynesianism: expansionary fiscal and monetary policy
		* But no organic, proximate connection to modern production, c.f. road-building in the New Deal which had a direct connection to the automobile industry
3. Transformation narrative: sustained growth requires breakthroughs on both the supply and demand sides, and there is no automatic correspondence between the two
	* Keynes is not actually a general theory, it is specific to Great Depression
	* Supply side: lift up retrograde businesses and backwards parts of industry by giving them access to advanced technological practices and to markets
		* Reach individuals too -- vast parts of the parts of the labor force are in insecure/precarious employment, the middle class has been hollowed out
		* Need to reach those detached from large firms: nurse practitioners, IT support
		* Transform into “technologically equipped artisans” -- not just skills, but support
		* Then go down to lower part of labor market -- janitors, shelf-stackers
		* Then up the ladder to medicine, law, engineering
	* Prioritize things that give access to advanced practices, power to share/manage assets in enterprises where they work
	* In the U.S., need to refinance the state -- the aggregate tax take is at least 10% lower in Europe, which is incompatible with reconstruction
		* Only way to do this is an indirect/regressive tax on consumption, which will be “gained back” (in terms of undoing the regressivity) on the spending side
		* Progressives don’t like this -- they are against *all* regressive taxation
	* Demand side: prefer distribution of assets to democratization of credit
		* Aspiration to property-owning democracy was replaced with credit democracy, which led to the crisis of 2008
		* Can’t have sustained expansion based on popularization of debt not backed up by sharing of assets
		* Can’t replace labor power with tax-and-transfer -- labor needs share in power, protection against insecurity, and a share of assets

*Focus on programmatic response: one aspect of supply side*

* Need a project of inclusive transformation
* What determines if we will break from business as usual? Education and access to the means of production
	* Education: knowledge economy has demanding requirements, general and technical
		* Prioritize depth over breadth, cooperation over individualism, dialectical practice
		* Quality can’t depend on geography or circumstance, which necessitates federal standards
	* Access to means of production has 3 stages:
		1. Broaden access to larger range of agents (firms and individuals) -- need a decentralized procedure to discover what works
		2. Need a different institutional architecture
			* Not American model of arm's-length regulation
			* Not northeast Asian model of industrial policy imposed top down
			* Need a third form: collaboration to the end of disseminating advanced practices
		3. Experiments with property and contract law need to be able to coexist in some market order

*Relation of structural to fragmentary change*

* Programmatic proposal should: (1) mark a direction and (2) select initial steps to move in that direction
* Constituency can’t be just the historical constituency of the left: organized labor in capital-intensive production
* Instead, need to build base, must include 4 elements:
	1. Workers in traditional capital-intensive sectors
	2. Precarious workers
	3. Small business class
	4. Rank-and-file of professional business class (which is increasingly separate from plutocratic elite)
* Unifying theme: become bigger together by remaking institutional arrangements of the economy and the state
