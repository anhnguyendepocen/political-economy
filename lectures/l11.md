# Conclusions: Rethinking political economy

**Rodrik**

* Antecedent model: New Deal/welfare state, settlement between working class (accumulated through Industrial Revolution) and business/financial elites
	* Significant social insurance
	* Job security through institutionalized labor markets (trade unions, collective bargaining)
	* Regulated finance
	* Mass production
	* Keynesian macroeconomic management -- activist fiscal, monetary policy targeting stabilization of aggregate demand
	* “Thin” globalization: Bretton Woods and IMF = capital controls, GATT system
* Collapse of this model:
	* Technological change with unequal rewards
	* Hyperglobalization
	* Financial globalization: free flow of short-term capital
	* Deinstitutionalization of labor markets
	* Deindustrialization (premature in low- and middle-income countries)
	* Neoliberal narrative on macroeconomic management: downplayed active management, emphasized markets, austerity
* Empirically: decline of middle-class share of income; employment prospects and wage of middle class has suffered most (worldwide)
* Three interconnected challenges:
	* Inclusion: how do we ensure those who have been excluded from advanced technologies are reincorporated?
	* Growth: address slowdown of productivity growth in advanced countries, premature deindustrialization in developing countries
	* (Political: authoritarianism, personalistic strong-man politics)
* Common root: scarcity of productive, stable middle-class jobs
* Remedies?
	* New social contract based on new “industrial” policy
		* Increase supply of good jobs
		* Redirect innovation in labor-friendly direction
	* State strong enough to achieve inclusive growth, but not strong enough to smother pluralism
	* Balanced globalization. Encourage pluralism, but focus on:
		* Global public goods (pandemics, climate change)
		* Beggar-thy-neighbor policies (global tax havens)
		* Areas with large economic gains (labor mobility)

**Unger**

* Transition in most advanced practice of production: traditional mass production to knowledge economy
	* Smith and Marx understood that best way to understand alternative futures is to look to most advanced practice
	* Transition has produced a disappointment and a danger:
		* Appears as series of exclusive fringes
		* Leads to economic stagnation, aggravation of inequality
	* How do we deepen and disseminate the most advanced practice?
* Broader focus: situation and sequel to last major moment of institutional and ideological refoundation -- the social democratic/social liberal settlement developed after WWII
	* In US: New Deal welfare state
	* Regulation, attenuate inequality retrospectively (tax-and-transfer), countercyclical management
	* Most important problems can’t be addressed within the limits of this compromise
* 3 problems in political economy:
	* Relation of backward to advanced practices of production
	* Relation of labor to capital
	* Relation of finance to production
* Social cohesion: money transfers organized by state against background of ethnic homogeneity
	* As homogeneity fades, inadequacy of money as social cement is exposed
* Under arrangement of weak democracies, change continues to depend on crisis
	* No trauma, no transformation
	* Need form of democratic politics that diminishes dependence of change on crisis
* Methods: we have a problem in contemporary thought with the discussion of structural discontinuity, structural alternatives
	* Classical thought had structural vision which was corrupted by various forms of determinism (Marxism)
	* Contemporary social sciences: deficient in structural imagination
	* Embarrassment in programmatic arguments: feasible but trivial vs. interesting but utopian → everything proposed likely to be dismissed as trivial or utopian
		* Fall back on bastardized criterion of political realism: proximity to the existent
		* False dilemma threatens to inhibit the programmatic ambition
* Hope: past great thinkers had generous vision of unrealized human opportunity motivating search for transformation
	* This whole course is a bet on the marriage of insight to hope

* The only democracies we have are weak and low-energy
	* Based on low level of people’s engagement in political life
	* Awaken only when there’s trouble
* Not persistent tests of established structure
* Alternatives: authoritarian vanguards that claim to speak in name of collective interest, but hold this collective interest ransom to their dogmas
* Transform weak democracies into strong democracies: depends on institutional innovations in the form of democratic politics
	* Increase level, tempo of politics
* Basic schema of ideological controversy: state against the market (more of one or the other, or synthesis of market and state)
	* Different conception of ideological contest: alternative institutional form of the market, independent civil society
* World is restless under dictatorship of no alternatives
