## The relation between finance and the real economy as a context for reshaping the market order

**Unger**

* Three themes today:
	1. Present coronavirus crisis as a transformative opportunity
	2. Relation of finance to real economy, financial instability to economic breakdown
	3. Develop second discussion in an application to the nature, causes, and consequences of 2008 crisis
* Two major themes of class have been: (1) alternative institutional forms that market economy can take and (2) evolution of productive apparatus of society, in particular, the most advanced practice of production and its relation to rest of economy
	* Frequently referred to idea of a "war economy without a war"
	* History has handed us an astonishing and unwanted example of this problem
	* We have a crisis that in some respects evokes idea of war economy -- many political leaders referred to this concept
	* It is (should be) a war economy in the emergency production of medical equipment
		* State is source of both demand and supply
	* But in a larger sense, this is the inverse of a war economy
		* A radical breakdown in supply and demand where the major part of labor force is sent home
* Transformative response to this problem in 4 areas:
	1. Income of workers
	2. Skills of labor force
	3. Revenue of businesses
	4. Organization of emergency production
* Propose thought experiment: consider what a progressive political force would do in response to this emergency if it had the institutional and productivist focus that almost all existing progressive forces lack
	* Conception of what could happen if we had the right ideas and the right will
* Preliminary: who will pay for it? Initiatives require a large amount of money
	* If ever there were a circumstance in which state has no narrow public finance constraints, this is it
	* All of this spending would represent replacement income and revenue
	* So a great deal could be spent without provoking inflationary spiral
	* State could finance initiatives by creating money -- increasing or monetizing public debt
* Income of workers: state has to guarantee large part of wage that workers no longer earn
	* Same principle must apply to self-employed or semi-employed workers
	* Medium to long term: opportunity to experiment with insurance against “black swan” risks -- radicalize, generalize principle of social security
* Skills of labor force: opportunity to use crisis to increase skills of labor force
	* Network with each other within and outside firms
	* Long term -- not just boost to productivity, increase in extent to which workers are independent from firms
* Business revenue: governments around the world propose to guarantee revenue
	* Should not be uncompensated -- demand reform to executive remuneration, increase in workers' rights
* Emergency production: specific corner of this problem in which example of war economy is most apposite
	* Governor of NY: propose medical supply chain be nationalized, President resisted: “nationalization is a bad concept”
	* War Production Act 1950 gives wide powers to federal government to direct businesses to produce what needs to be produced
		* Point of departure for innovative institutional engineering
		* Not just centralized direction of production, but development of public-private partnerships to work in areas that don’t correspond to short-term demands, but to long-term strategic imperatives
* No insuperable technical, financial, economic or legal obstacle
	* Obstacles are fundamentally political and ideological -- ideas and will

**Rodrik**

* Agree that crisis is not one that poses significant technical/intellectual challenges
	* Puzzle is why so much of the world is failing at meeting those challenges
	* Many of ideas have not percolated up
	* Massive problem of social cooperation and coordination, not just ideas and will
* Alternative thought experiment: imagine US had taken threat seriously -- testing kits employed, federal government had invested in widespread testing, would have enabled us to tell who was infected → enabled us to quarantine those who are infected
	* Only stay home 2 weeks → 1.5% GDP lost
	* Instead, we have supply shock with spillover into demand side
	* Now estimate Great Depression levels of unemployment
	* South Korea taken an approach closer to the one here
		* Deployed widespread testing and social distancing very rapidly
		* Not an authoritarian state, so this is possible in democracy
* Traditional Keynesian approach won’t work -- we have a supply shock (ask people to stay home), so significant fall in GDP is inevitable (part of needed public health response)
	* What we can do is support income
	* Britain/Germany: firms being paid to keep workers employed
* Uncertainty about crisis → supply shock creating induced demand shock
	* Even if paid 80% of salary, uncertainty about future → consumers don’t want to spend a lot money
	* So, needs to be significant Keynesian action to increase aggregate demand
	* Particularly with respect to medical supplies
		* Hard to understand why federal government is not directly requisitioning medical materials from suppliers
		* Letting states compete with each other
* Failure of global cooperation
	* WHO could have played much bigger role
	* Arguably greater need for cooperation in public health than in economics (IMF, OECD)
* Failure of many political systems to produce leadership and response makes DR skeptical that we can envisage bridge to productivist agenda
	* Optimistic side: no longer take for granted social/economic arrangements, role of the state, prevailing nature of ideas -- opening for the kinds of things we’ve been discussing

**Unger**

* Promise of interaction between bold governmental initiative and cooperation/social organization
* Disposition to cooperate is influenced by culture
	* But not just a constant
* Emergency production of needed medical equipment: cooperation becomes essential
	* Ex: Automobile factories don’t immediately know how to produce ventilators
* Capacious view: not just the state acting unilaterally, rather creating opportunities for cooperative breakthroughs

**Rodrik**

* Question of how we’re going to pay for this doesn’t arise
	* Low interest rate environment already
* Supply side crisis might generate inflationary pressure, but we haven’t seen that
	* Induced demand side effects are playing a role in dampening inflation expectations
	* Not a time to be fiscally conservative
* Fair amount of consensus:
	* Income support, support demand, invest in medical supply chain, increase capacity at hospitals, backstop financial system (happening through ECB and Fed), work with small and medium businesses to ensure they have resources
	* Much of debate is about practicalities of that

* Can we just print money?
* **Rodrik:** As long as you have a use for it, as long as it doesn’t increase inflation
	* Inflation is the sign you’re running into a resource constraint
	* As long as inflationary expectations and inflation are low, that’s a sign you can increase supply of money (“helicopter money”)
	* Not a big difference between traditional economics and MMT on this front
* **Unger:** Distinction between two levels
	* One level: money created by state is being used to replace personal income/business revenue
		* In principle, you can go a long way without provoking inflation
	* Second level: inflation becomes functional equivalent of a tax
		* Intervening in distributive conflict with advantages and disadvantages
		* Historically, one way states have managed distributive conflict
* **Rodrik:** Even in first level, loss in income is happening because people are not working
	* If we give them income, it’s income that has no counterpart in real production
	* Immediately find ourselves in second phase -- we cannot give them real income, only can give income by taking purchasing power away from someone else
	* But this is not the situation we’re in because no increase in inflationary expectations
	* Loss in income to workers generated by loss of expenditures (reduction of demand) -- but we’ve generated supply shock by asking people to stay at home
		* So there’s an element that can’t be compensated by giving people more money
		* Unless you find a way to increase production

* **Unger:** Continuing dispute with DR, “if it’s already hard to reach the minimum, why are you asking for the maximum?” → need to have higher transformative ambition to deal with basics
* **Rodrik:** Interpret this as: “Why make it difficult if you can make it impossible?”
* **Unger:** Need interaction between state initiative and mobilization of organized civil society
	* Historical reality is that interaction cannot happen in an atmosphere of programmatic minimalism
	* Only happens when there’s a transformative campaign

**Rodrik** 

* Share of financial industry profits as total business, share of finance in US GDP, stock market trading volume over GDP, all up
* Prior to global financial crisis, extraordinary scale: Ireland, Iceland (acting as hedge fund with stocks of financial assets and liabilities 10x GDP)
* One would expect that some good would come out of financialization
	* Narrative behind financial liberalization, deregulation, globalization is that they produce benefits
		* Within economy: diversification of risk, distribution of risk from those who do not have ability to bear it to those who do
			* Enable access to homeownership to larger segments of population
		* Globally: transfer financial resources from rich countries to poor countries
	* World would experience boom in private investment and growth while experiencing reduction in overall volatility
		* Those expectations have not been borne out
		* No increase in real resources devoted to investment in developing or advanced countries
			* If anything, private investment has stagnated
* Left with deep disconnect between finance and real economy
	* At best, a source of consumption support for parts of the middle class
	* Spurred homeownership, but in a way that created systemic risk and financial distress
	* Exception: moments of crisis, central banks act as lenders of last resort to commercial banking sector, parts of real economy
		* This morning: Fed preparing credit facility for lending to small and medium sized enterprise
* “Smart” development banking
	* Out of fashion -- many countries closed down
	* Finance long-term investment in environments where not available through normal commercial means
	* Complemented with another role: intelligence gathering, where are there opportunities for new investments?
		* Tightly connected to productive opportunities in private sector
		* Make intelligence available to the state and other parts of private sector
* Public venture funds
	* Governments can borrow at very low interest rates → set up quasi-independent venture funds, managed independently, take ownership shares in startups or firms investing in new technologies
	* Direct investment towards employment-enhancing or green technologies

4 sets of comments:

* Locate discussion of finance in general idea of economic instability
	* 2 fundamental causes of instability
		1. Absence of spontaneous/automatic correspondence between supply and demand
			* Keynes concerned with one version -- violation of Say’s Law, aggravated by downward rigidity of wage
			* But there are many ways supply and demand can fail to be connected
		2. Troubled relation of finance to real economy
			* Keynes: came out of psychological tradition of English political economy
			* Liquidity of money balances allow them to serve as plaything of waves of elation, despondency, greed, and fear
			* But this is a limited and inadequate understanding of a more general phenomenon
* Orthodox way of thinking about finance, and what’s missing from it
	* Orthodoxy: If there is a problem with finance, originates in failure of competition in capital market (such as asymmetry of information) or in failure of regulatory response to localized market failure
		* Under this view, makes no sense to say finance is more/less closely related to productive agenda of society
		* This selective blindness is an example of the false assumption that market economy has single natural, necessary form
		* When Americans in first half of 19th century disbanded national bank and created most decentralized system of credit that had ever existed, they were creating institutional arrangements that tightened relationship of finance to real economy, not simply regulating
* Conventional way of thinking cannot elucidate some things:
	* Under existing arrangements of market economy, production system is largely self-financed on basis of retained, reinvested private earnings
		* What is the point of money in banks and stock markets?
		* Vast amount of financial activity has oblique relation to production
	* Under these arrangements, finance is relatively indifferent to real economy in good times, destructive in bad times
		* When things are going well, productive system largely finances itself
		* In times of trouble, distress spills over into real economy
	* In principle, most important responsibility of finance: fund productive agenda of society, fund creation of new assets in new ways
		* Turns out to be miniscule part of financial activity
		* Venture capital, even in U.S, where it is most established, represents less than 0.5% of financial activity
	* Explanation: structure/arrangements that leave finance disconnected from production
		* Best way to make it less dangerous is to make it more useful
* Programmatic horizon: What can we do?
	* Negatively: discourage or prohibit financial activities that have no relation to enhancement of production or productivity
		* Options, derivatives contracts increase liquidity in commodity markets but not clear they have a similar role in equity markets → turn into instrument of gambling
	* Positively: channel finance into productive investment
		* Smart investment banks, quasi-public venture funds are examples of this
		* Pension systems could be placed in diversified portfolios of risk that would do the undone work of venture capital
* Connect to crisis of 2008. Conventional response to crisis emphasized stimulus (Keynesianism) and re-regulation of finance
	* Causal background of crisis -- what was origin of problem?
		* Most fundamental origin: country stopped producing enough goods and services that rest of world wanted
	* Masked absence of productivist project with form of economic growth led by mass consumption
		* In principle, requires democratization of purchasing power -- but in late 20th century, violently regressive redistribution of wealth
			* How to reconcile cheap money and debt/credit with regressive wealth/income?
			* Replace property-owning democracy with fake credit economy, made possible in part by overvaluation of housing stock as collateral
		* Enabled by structural imbalances in world economy -- debt and credit style of growth financed by export of Chinese financial and trade surpluses
			* Each country used structural imbalance to escape imperative of structural change
			* Americans escaped need for productivist project and need to distribute assets to uplift production/democratize demand
			* Chinese replaced imperative of deepening internal market with style of growth based on exports to deficit-ridden US
	* Aggravated by regulatory approach (left untouched by response to 2008): regulatory dualism
		* Densely regulated area of finance where public moved (ex: FDIC), thinly regulated area supposedly populated by professionals who could take care of themselves
		* Everything that was prohibited in densely regulated area repackaged and done under different label in thinly regulated area
	* Response to crisis left whole causal background almost entirely untouched
		* Didn’t develop productivist project, didn’t disturb regulatory dualism

**Rodrik** 

* Revisit housing markets pre-2008. The narrative behind the credit market bubble in housing finance was one that was on the consumption side of the economy -- not directly productivist -- but story meant to be in line with social objective of increasing homeownership
	* Who wouldn’t want financial markets to serve homeownership?
	* Why don’t we introduce real competition into mortgage lending → take it out of hands out of monopoly of mainline banks, allow non-banks to make mortgage loans → create more access
		* Also, deregulate so intermediaries can offer creative, affordable mortgages
	* Worried about risk? Pool and package them into securities → farm them off to investors
		* Divvy up stream of payments into tranches, compensating holders of riskier ones, call on credit rating industries to certify that less risky ones are safe, then create derivatives to allow investors to purchase insurance (credit default swap)
	* Story is compelling -- financial innovation, increased competition, new intermediaries, new assets expanding benefits of middle-class homeownership
* Possible to see through tools of conventional economics that something was going to go wrong
	* Incentives create tremendous leverage, tendency for excessive risk taking not being internalized
	* Cautionary note: ensure that financial innovation is disciplined by economics

**Unger** 

* One aspect of what happened in this story: mortgage market came out of New Deal, most powerful device for deepening of capital markets
	* Organized through ingenious institutions -- Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae (quasi-public)
* Late 20th century: securitization of mortgage market under the pretext of increasing competition
	* But became device of speculation disconnected from economic reality
	* Layers of financial engineering -- transactions of real economy, rather than being subject of engineering, became simply the pretext 
* Inequality increasing in US despite broad-based mass consumption
	* Inequality + cheap money → asset bubbles
* What’s the regulatory response? 4 sets of programs
	1. Resurrection of New Deal policies and rules separating investment banks from regular banks
	2. New supervisory, liquidating authority in federal government (deal with too big to fail problem)
	3. International finance: new standards of capital adequacy
	4. New standards for consumer protection
* None of these things dealt with regulatory dualism and separation from real economy → complete failure
	* Now, new crisis against background of old failure
* Every time we try regulatory dualism, the same thing happens: we repackage all the things that are prohibited in thickly regulated sector and do them in the thinly regulated one
* Something like half of graduating class of Harvard College go into finance and management consulting
	* Pushing paper, gambling, rather than investing, making things, doing real things in the world
	* Absorbing leviathan proportion of profits, perverting and misdirecting the intellectual energies of the nation

* Q: How do we reconcile nationalization with decentralized production?
* **Rodrik:** Nationalization is a question about ownership. Mechanism through which it’s carried out can be decentralized → no conflict between ownership and control rights and how the work is organized
* **Unger:** Think again of the metaphor of wartime production: government says stop making cars, we need tanks → provides help, puts them in touch with people, but all it wants is the tanks
* Need to invent the institutional machinery of competitive experimentalism. The public initiative should not be seen as a suppression of that
* Logic of the market is the logic of an organized experimental anarchy -- we want more of that
* Need initiative by the state to help us have more of it
