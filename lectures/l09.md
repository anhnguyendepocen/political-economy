# Globalization and alternative globalizations: the international counterpart to these national debates

**Rodrik**

* William Jennings Bryan speech at DNC, 1896: “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold”
	* Gold standard was target of late-19th century American populists
	* Led by farmers angry at unification of commodity markets at moment of price deflation → prices of agricultural products coming down
	* Relatively scarce gold supplies → nominal interest rates high, even higher real interest rate, given deflation
	* This was a consequence of “tight money” -- no freedom to increase money supply, since it was linked to supply of gold
	* Backlash against financiers and bankers in northeast seen as proponents of these policies
		* Analog to today: globalization imposing strict constraints on conduct of economic policy at home which harmed sectors of economy (here, farmers) → political expression
* Alternative globalizations
	* We take for granted a particular type of economic globalization: IMF, WTO, global supply chains
	* All globalizations run on rules (explicit) and norms (internalized) -- don’t spontaneously arise from technology
		* Majority of countries that have embraced financial globalization (open capital markets) because they think that’s what good behavior is, not because they’re following rules
		* Who writes the rules? Whose preferences are privileged?
	* Could have globalization targeted at preventing/mitigating pandemics, with WHO at the center
		* Warning system, research budget for pandemics, prevention of export controls on medical equipment, regulated border closures…
	* Another alternative: Globalization targeted at slowing down climate change
		* Globally binding emission quotas, research budget for renewable energy, financing for transition to green energy
	* Globalization focused on human development and empowerment
	* Alternative forms of economic globalization, too
		* Which flows should be liberalized? Trade, finance, labor?
		* Should rules reach behind borders? In which areas?
			* Subsidies, industrial policies, emissions, tax regimes
		* Ex: Gold standard included aspiration to labor mobility, but not Bretton Woods or post-1990s hyperglobalization
		* Ex: Gold standard and post-1990s regime included restraints on domestic policies, but not Bretton Woods
* Tensions between democracy and economic globalization
	* Trilemma: choose two of national sovereignty, hyperglobalization, mass politics
	* Hyperglobalization = absence of transaction costs on cross-border trade and finance
		* No restrictions on goods, services, assets at the border
		* Harmonize monetary, legal, regulatory regimes
		* Credibly pre-commit not to deviate from these regimes
	* Differences in national institutional arrangements create cross-border transaction costs and impede globalization
	* Hyperglobalization runs on the logic of arbitrage → undermines differences in regulations and social models
		* More advanced labor standards? Firms will shift production to jurisdictions with lower labor standards
		* More capital market regulations? Banks go to locations where regulations are lax and export products
		* More progressive income tax? Wealthy individuals and corporations will move to lower-tax jurisdiction but do business in your market
	* Tensions are more manageable when economic integration is limited (GATT) or regulatory differences are small (U.S. states)
	* What kind of a state does hyperglobalization require?
		* Provide property rights, contract enforcement, monetary stability
		* No costs on free flow of goods or capital
			* Sacrifice other objectives to this
		* Problematic for democratic regimes, since we want the possibility of divergent policies/institutional arrangements
	* Democratic delegation: democratic rule can be constrained without creating undemocratic outcomes
		* Limit power of special interests
		* Enhance quality of democratic deliberation
		* Principle applies to international commitments, too
	* But there’s a difference between logic of hyperglobalization (justify any rules that restrict domestic autonomy to minimize transaction costs) and democracy-enhancing globalization (impose mostly procedural norms that enhance deliberation)
	* Gold standard: hyperglobalization + national sovereignty, seems incompatible with mass politics
		* Rules too strict for a representative system to maintain?
	* Bretton Woods: maximize democratic legitimacy at home -- Keynesian macro policies + welfare state + economic restructuring
		* Some sectors left out of international agreements
		* When international trade threatened to overwhelm social bargains (1970s: exports from newly industrialized countries affect low-income sectors in advanced economics) → carve out exceptions to give advanced countries room
		* Explicitly incomplete globalization
	* Hyperglobalization: Post-1990s, WTO + financial globalization
		* Due to failure of legitimacy where rules went too far (trade) -- too far from democratic deliberation
		* And failure of regulation where they didn’t go far enough (finance)
	* Another alternative: “global governance,” do away with national sovereignty entirely
		* “Quasi-federalism” at the global level
		* Ideal of the European Union
* Outlines of a desirable form of economic globalization
	* Benefits to all rather than a few
	* Enforce rules for global public goods
	* Leaves space for institutional diversity across nations

**Unger**

* Application of idea of hyperglobalization to labor mobility: seems like what DR and international technocracy mean by “hyperglobalization” is not meant to include radical advance in mobility of labor. Difference between mobility of capital/goods and labor is very significant.

**Rodrik**

* Yes, post-1990s globalization has not included labor markets
* But don’t want to simply extend hyperglobalization to labor
* Want more balanced tradeoff between pushing for gains from trade and maintaining institutional diversity
	* In the case of labor, would require us to move further towards globalization
	* But for goods and capital, move back

**Unger**

* One direction: there should be a radically different treatment of goods/capital and labor
* Other direction: they should achieve freedom together in small, cumulative steps
* This radical difference in direction is concealed under label “hyperglobalization”

**Rodrik**

* Is the ultimate goal complete mobility? That would be hyperglobalization
* My view: long-term tradeoff between gains from trade and gains from institutional diversity
	* This always establishes a limit to how much globalization we can have

**Unger**

* Movement of things and money is sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful
* Movement of people is sacrosanct: significance transcends the merely economic realm
	* But cannot be established instantaneously, radically
* Can’t put this on a spectrum of more or less globalization
* Radical capital mobility is dangerous: suppresses possibility of national development
* Paradox in mainline economic theory: division of world into sovereign states is an accident, an embarrassment -- why divide the world at all? Just creates transaction costs
	* Integrated world equilibrium is just a fantasy
	* Division of world into states is basis of trade theory
	* Why is the world divided? Because we value difference -- for moral and political reasons, as well as economic benefits

**Rodrik**

* Challenge idea that economics has no explanation for division of rules in sovereign units
* Local public goods: different communities have different preferences → want different types of institutional arrangements
* Idea of gains from trade rooted in comparative advantage; this theory applies to why we want different nation-states
* But this theory doesn’t explain why we have existing structure of nation-states

**Unger**

* Local public goods are a thin, impoverished basis for understanding value of nations
* More fundamental basis: fecundity of method of competitive selection depends on richness of material from which method selects (analog to Darwin)
* Not a provincial accident of people having different preferences in different places
* Difference has to be created -- we don’t want just the difference that arises spontaneously
* Another point: an assumption of established discourse about hyperglobalization is that more openness requires more harmonization (legal and institutional similarity) and fewer transaction costs
	* This is a fundamental mistake
	* History of economics and law show that many earlier experiments in globalization have pushed extent to which openness and trade is compatible with underlying legal and institutional difference
	* GATT characterized by legal and institutional minimalism
		* Prior history of same thing: lex mercatoria (merchant law) in European history
		* Whole point of international commercial law was to reconcile increasing trade with underlying legal and institutional diversity
	* The impulse of this discourse of harmonization and exaggerated significance of transaction costs is to connect openness with legal and institutional similarity

**Rodrik**

* How would we measure globalization/openness? Two different ways:
	* Quantities of flows. Lot of globalization because lot of trade, lot of investment crossing borders
	* Size of the barriers: Are there costs to goods/services/people moving across borders
* These can move in different directions. Can have barriers that are relatively high (GATT regime, Middle Ages) -- but still have a lot of flows because existing barriers enable countries to manage countries better, creating more hospitable environment for the flows
	* Bretton Woods/GATT regime: expansion in trade. Not primarily because we reduced transaction costs; bulk of expansion because countries individually prospered → ended up trading more with each other
* Differences are definitionally barriers
	* People get around these barriers by costly evasion -- bypassing local sovereignty, etc.

**Unger**

* Costs of differences are subsidiary to larger point: under established discourse which wants to associate openness with absence of difference, friends of difference are enemies of openness
* There isn’t a single spectrum of tradeoffs
* To what extent can we reconcile openness with underlying institutional difference is an empirical question. We can’t answer a priori

**Rodrik**

* Magnitude of transaction costs is empirical. But whether differences do indeed impose transaction costs can be answered a priori
* Normatively appropriate benchmark is the barriers, not the volume

Q: Why shouldn’t we make global governance a goal? Is harmonization of human rights part of hyperglobalization?

**Rodrik**

* Some areas where it’s easier to establish global norms, e.g. human rights
* Appropriately hyper-global regime (along with climate change, global health)
* These are domains of global public goods
* Not sure the same applies to labor. This economic obligation doesn’t rise to the same level
	* Global set of rules creating completely free labor markets is maybe not desirable

**Unger**

* We want world trade system to be based on free labor
* One the one hand, different countries have to be able to compete on basis of different returns to labor
	* Don’t want this to result in suppression of freedom of labor

Q: Post-1990 system hasn’t enhanced labor mobility. But not for lack of trying (consensus on economic benefits of immigration). 

**Rodrik**

* Business interests not successful at liberalizing immigration
	* Have not been as organized, though, compared to their efforts in IP, banking/financial regulation
	* Businesses can feel direct benefits in, ex: liberalization of H1 visas
	* Not organized where gains are more diffuse -- low-skill labor
* To get things done, need to use ideas and narratives, too
	* “Trade-related intellectual property rights” (TRIPS) -- economists did not want this, but the narrative (from Big Pharma) gave their cause legitimacy
	* We can provide counter-narratives

Q: To what extent can environmental and health globalizations be separated from economic integration?

**Rodrik**

* Could envisage world where every economy is independent (autarky) but climate is still a global public good
* How do we impose rules on carbon taxes? Can just charge countries through body like UN. Doesn’t mean they have to trade
