# Previewing the debates: economics, inequality, and the rise of populism and illiberalism in advanced and developing economies

*Brief history of political economy*

* Mercantilism: maximize gold in sovereign coffers
	* All economic activity in service of sovereign → private greed is bad, market highly regulated with guilds/cartels, monopolies
	* Maximize exports, minimize imports → trade surplus is good
	* Politics organized around absolutist/corporatist lines, sovereign hands out power at their discretion
* Classical liberalism: markets and private initiative leads to prosperity
	* Well-being measured not by gold but by satisfaction of individual preferences: consumption
	* Need minimal state: defense, property rights, justice
	* Markets should be as free as possible
		* Close correspondence with today’s libertarianism
		* Want markets separated from politics
* Welfare state: markets are not self-creating, self-regulating, self-stabilizing, self-legitimizing
	* Reaction to Great Depression and interwar turmoil leading to New Deal
	* Labor organization, expansion of franchise, mass media
	* Embed markets in a range of institutions: regulatory, redistributive, monetary/fiscal, conflict management…
	* In practice, Keynes + welfare state + industrial policy = government acts to structure the economy
	* National rather than global system of capitalism
		* Bretton Woods regime: slow down international commerce and finance
* Socialism: capitalism is based on exploitation of labor; history is history of class struggle
	* End goal is public ownership of means of production
	* Socialism not incompatible with markets or with democracy
* Neoliberalism: 
	* Arose from postwar boom + oil crisis, stagflation, debt crises
	* Keynesianism doesn’t work, markets are over-regulated and states overextended
		* So, must stabilize, privatize, deregulate → financialization, removal of price controls and trade barriers
	* Hyper-globalization, financial globalization, WTO, regional trade agreements, Eurozone/single market
* Different models rooted in different ideas of human nature, normative frames, ideas of how markets work (self-stabilizing and benign vs. unstable and exploitative), conceptions of politics
* This class responds to increasing *productive dualism* in developed countries -- some sectors doing much better than others -- which is normally a feature of developing countries
	* And to premature deindustrialization in the developing world
* Populism: claim to represent “the people” + rejection of restrains on use of executive authority
	* Political: aversion to institutions of liberalism, independent courts, etc.
	* Economic: aversion to independent regulatory agencies, independent central bank, eternal restraints

**Unger**

* Goal is to define the conditions of socially inclusive economic growth: maximum theoretical and programmatic ambition combined with minimum technical complication
* Take up 3 issues:
	1. Political context of argument, especially in North Atlantic
	2. Address organization/alternatives to market economy (the foreground theme of the course)
	3. Address character of ideas we need to pursue this (the background theme of the course) aimed at a redirection of the social sciences themselves

*Political context*

* In politics, the last great moment of realignment was in the mid-20th century, post-WWII
	* Established the social democratic/social liberal consensus (in the US, this is the New Deal)
	* Was a bargain between forces that wanted reshaping and that didn’t
		* The state was allowed to regulate, attenuate inequality through taxes and transfers, manage the economy countercyclically
	* Involved a social compact between capital and labor
	* This settlement has been eroded as a result of the cumulative impact of:
		* The change of the dominant paradigm of production from industrial mass production (standardized goods and services produced by specialized machines), hierarchical structures, semi-skilled labor, factories, big corporations to the knowledge economy
		* The financialization of the economy: finance detached from the productive agenda of society
			* Sector absorbs profits, talents, human energy and threatens to turn finance into a bad master, not a good servant
		* A particular form of globalization which constrains attempts to create alternatives in national space
	* The combined impact has been to diminish growth and confine it to the fringes of a new vanguard of the knowledge economy, and to increase economic inequality and insecurity
	* Left-of-center and right-of-center parties have responded by promoting greater flexibility in labor markets -- which is a euphemism for insecurity -* and offering regulatory/redistributive compensation through taxes and social spending
		* This response is inadequate to master the effects of inequality and insecurity
		* Working people feel abandoned by their political representatives
		* Centrist political forces have abandoned the attempt to craft a strategy of socially inclusive economic growth
			* In the US today, there *is* no strategy of economic growth
			* The residual strategy is “cheap money,” executed by a central bank: expansive monetary and fiscal policy
		* This creates a vacuum into which populism has risen
	* Populism: old (benign) American conception was to defend the working-class interests
	* The European definition:
		* With respect to policy: solve structural problems via non-structural means offered in the name of the people in an attempt to create a new basis of division
			* On the left: monied vs. moneyless → expansion of redistributive entitlements
			* On the right : foreigners vs. natives → imposition of restraints on migration
		* With respect to political action, pushes limits of established institutions → Caesarism, anti-institutional agitation
			* Premise is that we have to choose between the cold/institutional and the hot/extra-institutional (between Madison and Mussolini)
			* Excludes idea of institutions that raise engagement in political life

*Organization and alternatives to the market economy*

* In the national space, there are three themes:
	* The relation of the backward to the advanced parts of production
		* New vanguard of the knowledge economy, dedicated to permanent innovation but confined to fringes that exclude the majority of firms and workers
			* This drives stagnation and inequality
		* How do we make insular vanguardism more inclusive?
		* How do we change this rather than correct it after the fact?
	* The relation of labor to capital
		* Labor force consigned to precarious employment → degeneration of situation of labor vs. capital that seems incompatible with a sustained, inclusive rise in productivity
		* How do we redirect this? In the short term, address precarity; in the long-term, increase potential of new production to change the relationship between the worker and machine
			* Potential for a different kind of relation -- will technology result in unemployment/underemployment through automation that replaces labor?
	* The relation of finance to production
		* Indifferent in good times, destructive in bad times
* Connected to debate over globalization: imposes convergence to a particular kind of market economy
	* Forbids the kind of coordination that rich countries used to become rich
	* Enhances ability of capital to punish attempts to deviate

*Background theme: where do we get our ideas?*

* Largely from the discipline of economics
* But we need more than the ideas it provides to understand even economic problems
* Each of the social sciences has severed the link between insight into the actual and the imagination of the adjacent possible
