## The relation between labor and capital as a context for reshaping the market order

**Unger**

* Critique of neoclassical theory of firm leads to different options that are all unsatisfactory
	* Business roundtable (social responsibility) → place evaluation of “social direction” in hands of managerial elite
		* In practice: genuflect to political correctness of the day, reinforce whatever the current platitudes are. Why do we want this?
		* Harvard Business School motto: “Make profit with a conscience.” Would rather they just make profit and leave conscience to the public
	* Capital-intensive parts of economy: workers and employers have common interest against everyone else
	* Collaboration model: kind of corporatism in which firms do everything together with the state
		* Normal point of departure: as a condition for receiving corporate charter, the corporation must obey whatever is established by law
		* Law determines social direction and conditions of corporate activity
		* To describe it as “regulatory policy” trivializes it

**Rodrik**

* Skeptical of social responsibility model, but two practical advantages:
	* Only one of four strategies that we’ve seen progress on
		* Large firms are doing something with practical effects
	* Rebecca Henderson at HBS one of the strongest proponents
		* She says this is not an alternative to the government or the law
		* Makes them more likely to be willing participants in government-led approaches
* When labor has sense of ownership, participation, good things follow: satisfaction, productivity, technology adoption that is more cognizant of interests of labor
* Law cannot specifically say what wage rate gig workers doing MTurk in this industry in that region should get, other complicated issues about employment standards
	* How do those get determined?

**Unger**

* Law can say: you can have flexible contracts, but you have to pay them what you would otherwise
	* Courts and jurists develop series of standards and criteria
	* Law doesn’t determine details, it sets a direction
* If we listen to business school, we always have the pietistic prevail over the transformative

**Rodrik**

* Need flexibility in policy that the law cannot provide

Q: Do we think legal institutions are less prone to capture? In U.S., laws like right-to-work being used against workers. 

**Unger**

* That’s the general problem of politics. Law is not part of the institutions
* 100% of the institutions are manifest in legal detail; they come from struggle in society over the arrangements
* We prefer this struggle over subcontracting part of democratic power to a group such as the managerial elite
* If there’s capture, the solution is more democracy
* Can’t hedge against politics. Politics is fate
	* Either you give the power to the people and recognize that they may make mistakes
	* Or you give power to custodians
* In the US, American liberals tried to sneak program through federal judiciary
	* What always happens: the empire strikes back
* In terms of custodians, the managers are at the bottom of the moral hierarchy

**Rodrik**

* Corporate social responsibility is partly due to abdication of national governments
* Firms might rather know what the rules are than have to voluntarily participate
* We have some international examples, but most of the action needs to happen at the national level

**Unger**

* Emphasize the labor force and the nature of free labor in the contemporary economy, rather than the firm and its responsibility
* 2 connections to general themes:
	1. Linked to insular/inclusive knowledge economy
		* Technologically-provoked unemployment (automation discourse)
			* Take position that technological evolution is underdetermined → choice between technology replacing vs. augmenting labor
		* Historically, organization of labor within firms preceded by “putting-out system”
			* Now we see a new putting-out system
			* What we consider the “natural” way of organizing labor might turn out to be just an interlude between two putting-out systems
			* Increasing part of labor force consigned to precarious employment -- can’t allow “flexibility” to serve as pretext for precarity
	2. Alternative institutional forms of market economy:
		* Best thing is not to regulate, or compensate after the fact but to change it, in 3 domains:
			1. Organization of production, relation of backwards/advanced parts
			2. Relation of finance to economy
			3. Relation of labor to capital

*Short-term program*

* Proximate objective: increase chances that labor will be organized in a way that supports broad-based rise in productivity
* Ulterior objective: enhance economic freedom, agency
* Marx: most important feature of capitalism is that labor can be bought and sold
	* Is this the way things have to be?
* Establish policies and arrangements that increase likelihood that technology evolves in a way that augments rather than replaces labor. 3 categories of actions:
	1. Ways in which state can exemplify, encourage, mandate productive solutions that augment labor
		* Direct government action in areas such as defense technology
		* Fiscal and regulatory policy
	2. Industrial policy: attempt to uplift retrograde firms to bring them closer to frontier; assist autonomous economic agents → transform into technologically-equipped artisans
	3. Empower labor (by law) to have more access to advanced part of production, more power within advanced part of production
* Legal regime of organization of labor. 2 main sectors:
	1. Parts of economy with stable employment
		* What can or should the labor law regime be? 2 regimes:
			1. Collective bargaining that prevails in North Atlantic, developed to redress radical inequality of bargaining power in employment context. 2 principles: (1) decision to unionize is voluntary, (2) unions are independent from state
			2. Corporatist regime that predominates in Latin America. Originally developed in fascist Italy, adopted by leftist regimes in Latin America. 2 principles: (1) everyone automatically unionized, (2) union structure under direction of state, typically through Ministry of Labor
		* Despite suspect origins, corporatist regime has 3 advantages:
			1. Unionization is automatic. A “gift of the law.” Struggle of workers is not whether to unionize, but what to do with union power
			2. Solidaristic tilt: less likely that union system reflects and reinforces underlying inequalities of production system
			3. Favors claims that are more than economistic (i.e. wages and benefits) -- has an institutional and political dynamic
		* Unacceptable vice: subordination of union movement to the state
		* Solution? Hybrid regime:
			* From corporatist regime, take automatic unionization
			* From collective bargaining, take freedom of union from the state
	2. Unstable/precarious employment. 2 discourses:
		1. Traditional labor discourse predicated on collective bargaining/corporatist regimes, wants to outlaw unstable employment as circumvention of labor laws. 2 defects:
			1. Can’t turn back the clock and suppress new practices of production by decree
			2. Serves interest of organized minority against disorganized majority
		2. Neoliberal discourse preaches radical flexibility
			* Erode rights of workers and throw them into radical insecurity
	* Should distinguish flexibility (unavoidable or desirable) from radical economic insecurity
	* Need a new legal regime for unstable employment
		* These workers should be organized and represented
		* Legal principle of price neutrality: unstable employment remunerated at level at which they would be remunerated in stable employment
		* One point of departure: Scandinavian system of labor rights and social rights that are universally portable

*Long-term program*

* Economic freedom becomes a central aim. 3 aspirations:
	1. No human should be condemned to do work that can be done by a machine
		* Reserve our time for the not yet repeatable
		* Machines don’t have imagination
		* Create condition for our partnership with machines
		* This is the opposite of traditional forms of production: worker worked as if he were a machine
			* We want the opposite, but it’s unlikely as long as wage labor becomes predominant form of free work
	2. Character of free labor. 3 main forms: wage labor, self-employment, cooperation
		* Liberals and socialists up to middle of the 19th century thought that economically dependent wage labor is a inferior and transitive form of free labor that would give way over time to self-employment and cooperation
			* Everyone believed this, not just Marx. Lincoln, John Stuart Mill
			* End of 19th century → predominance of wage labor came to seem natural and necessary
			* How do we implement this idea in contemporary economy?
			* Idea ran into problem of scale in 19th century 
	3. Need innovations in property regime
		* Develop range of ways in which economic agents can have decentralized access to productive resources and opportunities
		* Property is a bundle of powers that can be disassembled, components vested in different stakeholders → superimposed claims on same productive resource
			* Ex: productive resources vested in decentralized funds, use auctioned off to those groups who can offer highest rate of return (temporarily)
			* Alternative systems of property and contract coexisting experimentally within same market order

*Philosophical remark*

* The premise of this set of ideas is that we can aspire to have freedom in the economy, not just freedom from the economy
* Marx and Keynes believed we were on the verge of overcoming scarcity, and in the world beyond we could escape hateful burden of work and enjoy “private sublimities”
	* Both of these are false. We are not about to overcome scarcity
	* Also, not true that work is just a hateful burden
		* Under the knowledge economy, if we heighten trust and make work approximate the activity of imagining and producing, work can cease to be a hateful burden. But for whom?

**Rodrik**

* Agree on wage neutrality: unstable workers → same conditions as in organized labor force. There should not be a dualism in structure of employment
	* In the taxi industry, avoid “Uberization” of workforce

**Unger**

* Corporatist labor law regimes: Unions negotiate on behalf of large categories of workers sector by sector

**Rodrik**

* Advantage of corporatism: universality
* Labor power, even in capital intensive parts of production (Amazons and Googles), might have valuable spillovers? RMU disagrees
* New technologies can augment labor directly or indirectly:
	* Technology that gives nurses skills to do what doctors do is a direct augmentation of nurses’ labor
	* Alternative: increase number of tasks that need to be performed
		* New technology enables teachers to discern learning styles of different students and provide customized education in a highly differentiated way
		* Increases the tasks that teachers can do -- indirect augmentation of labor
	* How do we change incentives to do both of these things?

**Unger**

* Up to now, thought of this as race between human and machine (i.e. who’s better at playing chess?)
	* In certain respects, machines are more powerful
	* But we have a different hierarchy in the direction of imagination
	* Subsume actual under range of transformative variation
	* We can discover before we’ve made sense of something, in violation of our own methods and presuppositions, and then develop methods to make sense of them retrospectively
	* Enhances hope of partnership between human and machine
* Creation of breakthroughs depends on sifting through alternatives: experimentation
	* Humans have to do it through time. Experimentalism requires time, but it’s our scarcest resource
	* Machine does it through computational power, which can be almost instantaneous
	* If machines can help us deal with our scarcest resource, time, they can be immense ally in our liberation
