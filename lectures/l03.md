# The challenge and opportunity presented by today’s knowledge economy

## The nature and consequences of the insular knowledge economy

**Guest speaker: Yochai Benkler**

* Because of information asymmetries, socialized nature of individuals, central role of institutions, markets are pervaded by power
	* Social relations of production/culture, etc. are structured around power
	* Here, social = set of institutions and ideologies
* Understand postwar period as a structure of social relations with importance placed on expertise, managerialism, Keynesianism, big business, unions
	* Assembly line method of production, Hollywood system of cultural production
* Transition from the 1970s through the Great Recession has been toward self-interested individuals
	* On the right: individual rationality, on the left: self-actualization
	* State recedes from economy
	* Shapes how technologies get deployed, increases competition in labor markets, shifting power from labor to capital
	* Financialization → internationalization
* At the macro level: readjustments in ways that redistribute power (not just about comparative productivity)
* Markets invest in institutions, technology, ideology that allows them to extract rents
	* Horizontal power: decrease competition for their markets by eliminating innovators
		* Consider the App Store or Facebook -- learn which apps are successful on the platform then introduce direct competitors
	* Vertical power: over workers, suppliers, consumers
* Labor management platforms make sure workers are paid only when it’s useful for employers → this has to be backed by labor market institutions
	* Consider Uber’s institutional framework which enables them to offload all risk onto drivers
* Increase in computational capacity, decrease in productivity growth, decrease in business dynamism, increase in concentration, increase in markups, oligarchic extraction in the 1%, wage stagnation
	* Explanation: state stepping back because of neoliberalism
* Need to find a way to harness the state to contain the market -- shrink the domain of the market
	* Karl Polyani: everything turns into a commodity
	* This only happens when the state removes the ability to act outside the market
	* Want to decommodify basic necessities: Medicare for All, public savings, free college, etc.
	* Goal is to alleviate imperative of selling to the market
* Restructure power: increase antitrust, labor law, employment law, regulation of technology
	* Can we invert the surveillance system to create accountability?
	* Consider bodycams: initially used to subvert police authority, now they regularize it; they control the video, where it’s stored, etc.
		* This is a function of the institutional setting, not the technology itself
* Socially embedding production -- pre-capitalism, embedded in relations
	* Idea of market autonomous of social obligations is a new one
	* Sanders' idea of worker ownership: grant 2% per year stock to workers
	* Recreate “what a manager needs to do” as a battle in the ideological sphere
* What role can the state play to leverage fiscal power to enable cooperativism?
	* Quasi-utopian vision: some form of homesteading; intervention by state to help construct technology to produce what they need, embedded in social relations that use distributed materials, not centralized production
* Labor-displacing vs. labor-augmenting robots? Nothing inherent in the technology that pushes for one or another -- technology doesn’t develop exogenously
* Can’t depend on the notion that the state is infallible
* Used to be more anarchistic -- skepticism about the state and the way it’s captured by business, military-industrial complex
	* Radical distribution of computation was first time since Industrial Revolution that the capital requirements of production were distributed in the population
	* Possibility of non-market production as an alternative to the market/state production
	* Seemed possible, but no historical force that would necessarily make it happen → political battles over laws are central
		* Copyright, DRM systems made it easier to enforce one-sided contracts; see this as an ideological battle
	* Focused too little on Google, Apple
		* This changed around 2008 with the introduction of platforms, which introduced points of control that let them recapture power
		* State, too: propaganda, surveillance
* Realized that we need the sustaining, fiscal power of the state, but we can’t ignore elite capture

**Unger**

* Market order is cast against social solidarity
	* Terminology of “embedding” and “re-embedding” is dangerous
* Social relations combine power exchange and allegiance
	* "Sentimentalism of equal exchange"
	* Marx said: good riddance, we don’t want that kind of embedding
* Unsentimental version of it: sustain high investment in people and capabilities, withdraw from market’s uncertainty a basic package of security-ensuring endowments
	* But consisted in a set of insider deals to the detriment of outsiders
	* We don’t want that! We don’t want to re-embed market in social relations in this way
* Three concerns:
	1. Economic security and plasticity
	2. Inequality: we want to change the fundamental distribution of advantage
	3. Social cohesion: money transfers not adequate social cement (without racial/cultural homogeneity)
		* Need collective action: innovation in the economic/political arrangements
* Two themes:
	1. Knowledge economy: do firms prefer technology that extracts rents rather than increases productivity? 
		* Another explanation: there is increased productivity in vanguard, but the problem is that the knowledge economy doesn’t spread
	2. Market order, containment by state: but the market is not one thing → which market order? The market has no one form
		* Can we change the market order by innovating in fundamental legal mechanisms?
