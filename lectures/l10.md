# The struggle over the shape of the market order and the contest over ways of thinking: the role of economics and of its possible reorientation

**Unger**

* Begin with background theme: alternative futures of economics itself. Where will we get the ideas we need to think about the problems we have been addressing?
* This is where he and DR fundamentally disagree. DR sees nothing fundamentally wrong with established economics
	* RMU recognizes economics is the best established of social sciences
	* Forces on us clarity, especially about tradeoffs and constraints
	* But it’s not enough
* Difficult to address nature of limitations/alternative directions because:
	* Confusion of relation of subject matter to method
		* Economics is not study of the economy; it’s the study of a method pioneered by marginalist theoreticians of end of 19th century
		* Study of economy by another method (e.g.: Weber) is not regarded as economics
		* Study of something that has nothing to do with production and exchange might be regarded as economics because it deploys this method
	* Familiar criticisms (unrealistic assumptions about competition or rationality) are almost all uncomprehending → rightly dismissed
		* Arise from failure to understand character of method and its ambitions
		* These misleading criticisms crowd out the criticisms we need
	* Attempted heresies during course of evolution of mainline economics
		* Dialectic of these largely failed heresies suggests we have everything we need by way of intellectual diversity
	* If we arrive at conclusion that economics in present state is insufficient, then we have no alternative readily available
		* Absence of alternative dissuades us from pursuing criticism and reconstruction
* Place problem of economics in narrative of modern social thought
	* Classical European social theory was a theory of structure -- structures that exist in history, how they change, laws that govern their operation and transformation
	* Paradigm was Marx’s critique of English political economy
		* English economists represent as universal laws what are actually regularities of particular economic regime: capitalism
		* Regimes and structures are contingent and revisable
			* But this was circumscribed by classical social theory by a series of deterministic illusions
			* Thought there was a closed list of regimes, each an indivisible system, with a script governing their foreordained succession
			* Subsequent thought rebelled, but suppressed structural imagination altogether
	* Each social science has severed link between insight into actual and imagination of adjacent possible
		* They present as explanation what is a retrospective rationalization of established arrangements
	* Problems of economics are a variant on fundamental theme: suppression of structural imagination
* Deal with main line of economics resulting from marginalist revolution, suggest alternative account of its limitations
	* Marginalists (Walras, Jevens, Menger) saw economy as set of connected markets
	* Viewed operation of markets from the standpoint of individual agents (methodological individualism) who the best available means to achieve their goals
		* Competitive selection under constraint of scarcity
	* Results of individual decisions are aggregated by the market and manifest in the system of relative prices
		* Prices reshaped at the margin by the last decision → “marginalism”
	* This approach to the economy had 2 fundamental motivations:
		* Cut through confusion about the relation between underlying value and price that had beset pre-marginalist, “classical” economics
		* Create form of economic science relatively invulnerable to empirical controversy and ideological conflict
	* At time of marginalist revolution, there were many alternative directions for economics:
		* Edgeworth’s program: economics as psychological and behavioral science
		* Alfred Marshall: develop economics by analogy to natural history (weather or tides) -- context-bound, loose causal sequences
		* These have resurfaced, but never broken hegemony of approach that resulted from marginalist turn
* What are the limitations of this economics? 4 main ones:
	* Relative dissociation of formal analysis from causal and empirical investigation
		* Less a causal science than a form of logic
		* In its purest form, it’s an analytic apparatus, innocent of factual stipulations and normative commitments but also of causal theories other than residual causal theories that could be inferred from simple scheme of means-ends rationality under constraint of scarcity
		* Marginalist theoreticians exploited affinity of that scheme to deductive reasoning
		* This affinity helps explain why this economics reveres mathematics, but almost all math deployed in economics is relatively primitive
			* Not because economists are incapable, but because higher mathematics is useless to their method
			* Only a relatively simple mathematics is needed to carry the work of this quasi-logical science in which means-ends scheme is the basis of analogy to syllogistic reasoning
		* Characteristic procedure of economists is development and substitution of models to explain a set of economic phenomena
			* If model doesn’t work, create another one
			* At no point does substitution of models jeopardize underlying theory, because theory at its heart is not a causal theory making empirical statements -- it’s a logical scheme supporting deductive reasoning
			* Different from, e.g., Standard Model of particle physics
			* If Standard Model faced accumulating level of contrary empirical observation, there would be some attempt to “save” it by rearrangements among its propositions, or by context-bound qualifications, but would be swept aside
			* Can never happen in marginalist economics because there’s nothing in the elementary schema that anything that in the world could fundamentally impugn
		* This form of analytic invulnerability is an onus preventing dialectic of theory and discovery, of counterintuitive insight into workings of the world, condemning discipline to eternal infancy
			* But hasn’t economics become increasingly empirical? “Copious flesh hangs awkwardly from a frail skeleton”
			* Where does causal element come from? Needs to come from means-ends rationality or be imported from a different discipline -- behavioral or neuroeconomics (developing what was earlier Edgeworth’s program)
			* Or developed on the spot -- context-bound economics
	* Deficit of institutional imagination
		* Coexistence between 3 types of economics:
			* Pure economics: empty of institutional assumptions/commitments, exemplified by general equilibrium analysis
			* Fundamentalist economics: Hayek, associating abstract idea of market economy with contingent set of institutional and legal arrangements (contract, property)
			* Equivocating economics: macroeconomics, professes to study lawlike relations among large-scale aggregates against shadowy institutional background. Change in details of background matter, but because background is static, these details can be disregarded
		* To the extent this economics is rigorous, it is empty of institutional insight; to the extent it has institutional implications, it has them by virtue of equivocation and confusion
	* Lacking proper account of production
		* Before: theory of exchange and of production had same importance
		* Now: economics textbook chapter on production has almost nothing about what we would ordinarily call production
			* Almost everything is about factors of production and substitution, different forms of market organization
		* Reduction of production to shadowy extension of exchange made possible by a contingent feature of economies: in them, labor can be bought and sold (what Marx considered the most important feature of capitalism)
			* So production can be seen under lens of relative prices
	* Theory of competitive selection bereft of any account of how material from which the method selects is formed
		* Like if we had only Darwinian natural selection and not the part about genetic recombination
		* Fecundity of process depends on richness of material on which it operates
		* No account of economic life is acceptable if it’s missing that half
* Address 2 largely halfhearted and failed attempts to break out of trajectory that marginalist revolution established
	* Development economics
		* Albert Herschmann: potential to represent alternative direction for economic theory, but pursued strategy of peaceful coexistence with dominant paradigm, eventually swept aside, reduced to series of context-dependent studies
			* Squandered opportunity to be point of departure for consequential intellectual rebellion
	* Keynesianism
		* Most successful economic apostate of 20th century, but a contained apostasy: insufficient to serve as basis for program of critique
		* Almost no institutional content -- key variables all psychological: preference for liquidity, propensity to consume, long-term expectations
			* Tendency in English political economy of psychologism, prior to marginalism
			* Institutional observation limited to particular domains like stock market
		* Focus on demand side, rather than supply side
			* Can’t have alternative economics without comprehensive theory of breakthroughs on supply side and demand side (and relation between the two)
		* Theory of economic slumps was not a “general theory,” but one of a particular kind -- characterized by hoarding, rigidity of wages, inadequate demand
			* Inadequacy manifest in difficulty we have applying it to recessions of present day: leverage, expansion of credit masking absence of property-owning democracy, concentration of wealth resulting in asset bubbles producing vulnerability that begins in finance, but compromises real economy
		* Caught in between theory of equilibrium at low level of employment (which American followers adopted) and permanent disequilibrium
		* Lesson in dangers of partial intellectual rebellion. 4 stages:
			* Keynes focused on response to slump that he regarded as politically palatable: only focus on demand side
			* Year later, his follower Hicks developed IS-LM schema -- formulaic reduction of his doctrine
			* American followers (led by Samuelson) reinterpreted, downsized theory into theory of fiscal and monetary policy for countercyclical management of economy
			* Labeled “macroeconomics” and placed alongside inherited body of theory (redubbed “microeconomics”)
			* Under headings like “microfoundations of macroeconomics,” economists observed everything new in this theory was unnecessary and could be inferred from microeconomic/marginalist theory
	* After all of this, we have no way of thinking structurally about the economy
		* Leftists embraced vulgar Keynesianism when they abandoned Marx
* No alternative to a confrontation
	* Economics is useful, even indispensable as science of tradeoffs and constraints, friend of intellectual clarity and rigor
	* But it can’t bring us to the threshold of insight into structural alternatives
	* How to proceed? Most ambitious: a comprehensive theory. But this is the limiting case

* This picture of what an alternative economics might look like is setting standards we can’t meet -- possible advantages are outweighed by disadvantages
	* Mistakes RMU cited: those economists were looking for universal laws or a theory of history that also wants economics to do \textit{too much}
* Economists have carved out useful function by performing a certain trick: study of a method, rather than study of the economy
	* “Thinking like an economist” has compelling power
	* Sometimes taken too far -- economic imperialism
* Main disagreement: what RMU is looking for is something universal to think about structural alternatives
	* But not job of economics to provide that
	* Smith and Marx had a particular view of what economic progress might look like
		* Universalist view ended up backfiring
* Approach is immune to challenge? True that if particular model is challenged, it’s not the way of thinking that’s challenged, it’s the model
* Economics is different than natural sciences because in principle there is an infinite variety of social reality to describe -- no universal constants
	* Cause and effect relationship is always contingent in a potentially infinite number of ways
	* How can something so indeterminate be useful?
		* Ex: How would minimum wages work? Depends on competitive equilibrium vs. monopsony. It depends, but we know what it depends on, and we can empirically check which model is relevant
* Economics has moved from programmatic vision (Smith, Marx) to a discipline -- a deductive, analytical tool
	* Can distinguish analytical thinking from normative/ideological baggage
	* Normative substance needs to come from elsewhere
		* Chicago school libertarians: combined tools with normative judgements of inequality and practical view of government as corrupt
		* Krugman-type liberals: same tools, combine with different normative judgements on inequality and more hopeful view of government
* Failings of economics:
	* Mistake model for reality
	* Categorical preference for certain axioms (e.g. rationality)
	* Preference for problems that are amenable to these tools
	* Implicit political-economy theorizing in policy discussions
		* Especially in focus on efficiency as only way to evaluate policies
* What RMU calls a shortcoming is an advantage -- don’t want economists to lay claim to universal framework for thinking about structural alternatives

**Unger**

* Task of theory is to provide insight into transformation
	* To understand something is to understand what it can become
* If we use models to represent established economic phenomena, how do we understand how they change?
	* In post-marginalist tradition, theory is doing something else: exempting itself from insight into transformation and providing supposedly neutral analytical framework
	* Role that would be theory’s is played by “art”
		* “Intuition for model selection”
		* This shouldn’t exempt us from having a view on transformation
* Criticize invocation of intellectual modesty: “someone else will deal with structural matters”
	* In current day, central space of social theory and philosophy is vacant
	* Real debate happens in economics and law
	* Both barred themselves against responsibility of transformative insight
		* Economics as a result of history of marginalism
		* Law because it’s representing system of idealized policies and principles
	* Both disciplines are misdirected -- but we say someone else will do this work of imagining alternatives
		* “Someone else” has to be us

Q: A lot of legal thinking based on categorical morality. Economic thinking based on consequentialism: individual utility maximization, or social welfare. Is there a tension? How do we reform economic models?

**Unger**

* Diminishing marginal returns is pretty close to a law in economic thinking
	* If we could loosen or reverse this, we would have potential for exponential growth
	* If we think of innovation as functionally equivalent to input and it’s continuous rather than episodic, then we have potential to escape diminishing marginal returns
* No rich background of conversations about transformation of structure
* Phillips Curve stops working → something changed in institutional background → no way of thinking about relation between economic phenomena and institutional background. Another way we might begin
* We don’t have to treat this as prerogative of genius
* Can’t just enrich and contextualize economics. Look to natural science -- rich set of causal conjectures and a physical or social conception of how something transforms
	* Math may or may not be useful
	* But not toy mathematics that is simply the adornment of deductive reasoning
		* Sterile as methodological basis for thinking about transformation
