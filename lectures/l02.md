# The debates about economic growth and development

**Unger**

Today, address:

1. Basis for takeoff of Europe, basis for all subsequent expansions of growth
2. Growth “miracles” after initial takeoff
3. Emerging debate about growth and development today

* Until Industrial Revolution, growth was slow and fragmented
	* Agrarian empires: Chinese, Mughal
		* There was a recurrent problem that smothered growth and decentralized economy
		* Divided into imperial center, landholders, tradespeople/workers/peasants
		* Rulers depended on success in constraining magnates: state needs base of taxes and recruitment
		* Characteristic policies to limit greed of magnates
		* Not squarely on the side of the people → revolution
		* Repeatedly, imperial center failed to constrain landholders → fell apart, invaded, market order reverted to barter economy
	* In Europe, pattern broken by disintegration of Roman empire
		* State formation delayed, highly fragmented with space for independent personalities of towns
		* Nobody planned this
		* Consequence was an irreversible level of social, cultural, economic pluralism
	* Development of natural science that tried to understand nature beyond perceptual experience
		* Counterintuitive understanding of nature
		* Object is insight into transformations of nature to be used for our own benefit
	* Technological innovation is endogenous to growth process
		* Technology is a materialization of the conduit between experiments in the transformation of nature and experiments in cooperation with each other
		* Based on science and depends on opening of space by social/economic/cultural pluralism
		* When we can express formulaically, we embody in machine
	* Underlying assumption is the relationship between technological/economic revolution and background/society
		* Marx: development of forces of production requires revolution in the mode of production
		* Illusions:
			* 1:1 relation between level of development and way of organizing economy
			* Deterministic: closed list of modes of production, laws governing their succession in history
		* In fact, there is no 1:1 relation, but there seems to be a direction towards greater flexibility and plasticity
			* Trust and common purpose against different backgrounds
* Persistent elements of growth miracles: the mobilization, the opening, the shield. Ex: US in first half of the 19th century
	* Mobilization: never spontaneous, needs elite vision and strategy to mobilize national resources to the end of developing a new comparative advantage
		* In the US, this was Alexander Hamilton
		* War economy without a war: massive mobilization of resources, physical construction of country
		* Use of national debt to finance mobilization
		* Overarching and selective protectionism
	* Opening: in the 2 most important sectors, agriculture and finance, America had a “selective democratization” of the market order
		* Didn’t just regulate and attenuate retrospectively -- innovated in legal and institutional architecture
		* In agriculture: rejected agrarian concentration, distributed land on frontier, strategic coordination between government and family to protect family farming against unique risks through price supports, land grant colleges, stockpiles
			* Promoted “cooperative competition,” leading to economies of scale
		* Finance: Andrew Jackson dissolved 2nd National Bank, prohibited interstate banking, created decentralized system of credit
		* Constraint: innovation limited by power of entrenched interests (the path of least resistance)
	* Shield: protect from armed and belligerent states
		* Military: alliance between armed state and national economic experiment
		* Commercial: engage in world economy on terms conducive to own national experiment
			* State must enjoy power of selectivity
			* Ex: “tiger economies” (unlike Latin American countries) limited foreign capital
		* Fiscal: national rebels crafting growth miracles must be able to resist financial interests, domestic and foreign
			* Not the vulgar Keynesianism of counter-cyclical management -- must be subordinated to the interest of the shield
			* Fiscal realism not to win financial confidence, but so country can rebel against financial markets
			* This has contractionary effect -- need to neutralize through private and public investment
* Most advanced practice of production (not necessarily the most efficient) is the vanguard
	* Until recently, productive vanguard was industrial mass production
		* Context of world division of labor: capital-intensive production in central economies
	* Now, productive vanguard is the knowledge economy
		* Exists in every sector as the “intellectually dense” portion, but operates as an exclusive fringe
		* Its insular character leads to economic stagnation and inequality
	* New dilemma: traditional shortcut to economic growth has stopped working
		* Long-term growth depends on “fundamentals”: education and institutions
		* Shortcut: take workers and resources from less productive sectors and move them to the more productive sector
			* This has stopped working: consider deindustrialization
		* Why? The old vanguard is no longer the vanguard
		* Race to the bottom in terms of labor and taxes to the state
	* Alternative: socially inclusive new vanguard, but knowledge economy is quarantined even in richest economies with the most educated labor force
	* If dilemma can be broken, can be broken only by developing inclusive form of the new vanguard

**Rodrik**

* Empirical facts about inequality in the knowledge economy:
	* Within firms: outsourcing/offshoring through supply chains, platforms/gig economy
	* Across firms: within every industry, productivity between leaders and laggards growing
	* Wage distribution: winners and losers in labor market are diverging, even for the low-skilled (paid more if associated with productive center)
	* Spatial: urban centers diverging from the rest
* Secular stagnation: technological advances of today have less potential than 40 years ago?
	* A more straightforward explanation: the most productive technologies are being denied to most people, leading to a slowdown

**Unger**

* Knowledge economy is multisector → shouldn’t identify it with platform companies and the associated network effects
* Depends on legal/institutional arrangements -- companies pay nothing for data generated by customers, and this is not neutral; it is an artifact of the legal/institutional background
* How far can productive vanguardism extend? Reason to think it depends on exigent conditions, unlike mass production
	* Needs certain kind of education, accumulation of social capital (discretion and reciprocal trust)
	* Depends on legal/institutional innovation, alternative regimes of property and contract
* Industrial policy, by contrast, essentially consists of buying a few more years
* Current form of the knowledge economy is probably an example of the “path of least resistance”
