## The market order and inequality: the contrast between corrective redistribution and institutional change influencing the primary distribution of economic advantage

**Rodrik**

* Contrast redistribution through tax-and-transfer with changing institutions that influence economy
* Rise in inequality in Europe looks more moderate than in US
	* Why? Technology and globalization trends are the same
		* Way economy is organized, more extensive role of stateâ€¦
	* Difference shows how institutions and policies moderate globalization and technological shocks
* Three stages:
	1. Pre-production: people enter economy with endowments (networks, education, access to financial capital)
	2. Production: system of production creates market outcomes, produces income/wealth distribution
	3. Post-production
	* Can distinguish policies that act at these stages
		* Ex: education, UBI are pre-production
		* Taxes are post-production
	* Productivist policies intervene directly in stage of production, employment, innovation
* Three targets:
	1. Help people at the bottom
	2. Address wealth concentration at the top
	3. Target middle class insecurity, precarity
* Traditional focus: investment in health, public education (pre-production) and redistribution, social safety net (post-production)
	* Increasing discussion of policies that target production
* Focus on productivist policies addressing middle class: "good jobs"
	* Good jobs: secure employment with benefits, give workers sense of satisfaction
	* 3 categories:
		1. Address productivity of existing jobs and firms
		2. Increase number of good jobs by supporting startups, expansion; attract investment from firms elsewhere
			* Currently takes place in distorted form: tax subsidies create "race to the bottom"
		3. Workforce development programs, continuous investment in skills
* Kind of industrial policy: government intervenes to affect structure of production and direction of technological change
	* Traditional type (East Asian model of industrialization): top-down incentives -- promote specific sectors (shipbuilding, steel), use specific instruments (export, credit subsidies)
		* Presumes ex-ante knowledge and competence on part of public agencies
	* More contemporary: ongoing processes, strategic collaboration across levels. Design principles:
		1. Embeddedness: knowledge embedded in activities of participants
		2. Institutional capacity: ability to revise policy
		3. Clear benchmarks of what constitutes success
		4. Broader accountability
* Four advantages of this way of thinking:
	1. Structural approach: focuses directly on employment
		* Transition away from welfare state model
	2. Little market/state dichotomy
	3. No dichotomy between equity and efficiency
	4. Dichotomy between reform and revolution also disappears

*Philosophical prelude*

* How should we think about inequality? Ideological debate of last two centuries: "shallow equality" vs. "shallow freedom"
	* Left gives priority to equality, right gives priority to freedom
* "Shallow" because they are pursued against background of established institutional arrangement
* Theories of distributive justice (e.g. Rawls)
	* On their face, seem radically egalitarian
	* But they are philosophical prop to compensatory redistribution
	* Attempts to achieve equality via redistribution after the fact are limited
	* Pragmatic residue: attempt to attenuate inequality generated in the market through retrospective tax-and-transfer
* Alternatives? Deep equality: give priority to equality of outcome/circumstance
	* "We're all poor, but we're poor together"
		* Not our aim
* Deep freedom: Bring experience of ordinary people to higher level of intensity, scope, capability
	* Struggle against inequality is subsidiary to this larger objective
	* Narrower and deeper than equality of opportunity
	* Equality of *empowerment* -- opportunity to act
	* Conservatives say it is natural for life to be small -- exceptions are heroes, thinkers, saints, entrepreneurs
	* Progressives: become bigger only if we become bigger together
		* Resist inequality because it is a constraint on this shared empowerment
		* Method: structural change in institutional arrangements, ideological assumptions
			* Necessarily piecemeal

*Historical prelude*

* In medium to long term, equality *among* nations affected most by diffusion of most advanced practice of production
	* Short term, migration
* Long term, equality *within* nations affected most by ability to share in most advanced practice of production
	* Short to medium term, war
	* How can we achieve war economy without a war?
		1. Growth: massive mobilization of national resources
		2. Plasticity: large-scale mobilization together with radical institutional innovation
			* Create economic and political institutions that facilitate their own revision
		3. Solidarity: elites recognize that sacrifices must be rewarded
			* Peacetime equivalent: multiplication of forms of collective action within and outside the economy

*Relation of production to equality*

* Two options: diminish inequality by correcting inequalities generated in present market order; or diminish inequality by innovating in arrangements that shape fundamental distribution of advantage
	* Initiatives that affect primary distribution have more promise than attempt to correct after-the-fact
	* If we attempt to correct after the fact, we establish tension between established economic incentives and egalitarian commitment: "equity vs. efficiency"
	* This idea conflicts with certain orthodoxy
		* Piketty compares direct redistribution (e.g. mandate higher return to labor by increasing nominal wage) to fiscal redistribution
			* Says undermines price system as system for efficient allocation of resources
			* Direct redistribution results in less employment, preference for substitution of labor by capital
		* But doesn't consider extent to which fiscal redistribution can disorganize the real economy
* In influencing primary distribution, three elements have priority:
	1. Status of labor vis-a-vis capital
		* Need different legal regime to reconcile genuine flexibility in labor market with security
		* Future of wage labor as predominant form of free work (c.f. self-employment and cooperation)
		* Consequence of evolution of technology for substitution of labor
	2. Empowerment through productive uplift
		* Cooperative competition among producers
		* Aid to middle part of job distribution
	3. Education
		* Character/quality of general education: form of education that can empower, prefer selective depth to encyclopedic superficiality, approach all subjects dialectically
		* Technical/vocational training: analytic/technical capabilities rather than job- or machine-specific skills

*Relation of innovation in primary distribution to after-the-fact corrective policies*

* Three principles:
	1. Change in arrangements that shape primary distribution has priority over attempts to correct after-the-fact
	2. Common mistake: separate revenue and spending side and focus on progressive profile of revenue
		* Paradox: among rich industrial democracies of North Atlantic, the one that on paper has most progressive tax system is US
			* Relies on taxing personal income
			* European social democracies based on regressive/indirect taxation of consumption (VAT)
		* In the short run, what matters most for overall redistributive effect is *aggregate* tax take and how it is spent
		* Progressive taxation has marginal effect on inequality, but politicians' commitment to progressive taxation at election time becomes device to show who's side they are on
	3. Role for progressive redistributive taxation
		* Two targets: hierarchy of standards of living, accumulation of economic power
		* Progressive income tax hits neither squarely
		* Which instrument hits first target? Individualized consumption tax
			* Nicholas Kaldor: The Expenditure Tax
			* Take aggregate income (labor and capital) and subtract invested savings; tax this difference on steeply progressive slope
		* Second target: tax system reaches more bluntly
			* Tax hereditary transfer of property
* Central theme: equality without empowerment is a failed program
