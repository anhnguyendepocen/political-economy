# Political economy and its future

A class taught by Dani Rodrik (HKS) and Roberto Mangabeira Unger (HLS)
in Spring 2020. From the syllabus:

> The world’s economic and political order reels under mounting
> challenges: the global financial crisis, the austerity debacle, a
> slowdown in economic growth and productivity, the aggravation of
> inequality and the inadequacy of conventional responses to it, the
> discrediting of the Washington Consensus, the globalization backlash,
> the re-emergence of nationalist politics in Europe and the United
> States, and a contest over the meaning, value, and requirements of
> democracy. We examine connections among these phenomena and explore
> alternative ways of thinking about contemporary market economies and
> their reconstruction. We organize the course around four related
> themes: the worldwide financial and economic crisis of the recent past
> and its management; the effort to promote socially inclusive economic
> growth in richer as well as in poorer countries; the nature, fate, and
> dissemination of the new knowledge-intensive style of production; and
> the past, present, and future of globalization.

# Previewing the debates: economics, inequality, and the rise of populism and illiberalism in advanced and developing economies

**Rodrik**

*Brief history of political economy*

  - Mercantilism: maximize gold in sovereign coffers
      - All economic activity in service of sovereign → private greed is
        bad, market highly regulated with guilds/cartels, monopolies
      - Maximize exports, minimize imports → trade surplus is good
      - Politics organized around absolutist/corporatist lines,
        sovereign hands out power at their discretion
  - Classical liberalism: markets and private initiative leads to
    prosperity
      - Well-being measured not by gold but by satisfaction of
        individual preferences: consumption
      - Need minimal state: defense, property rights, justice
      - Markets should be as free as possible
          - Close correspondence with today’s libertarianism
          - Want markets separated from politics
  - Welfare state: markets are not self-creating, self-regulating,
    self-stabilizing, self-legitimizing
      - Reaction to Great Depression and interwar turmoil leading to New
        Deal
      - Labor organization, expansion of franchise, mass media
      - Embed markets in a range of institutions: regulatory,
        redistributive, monetary/fiscal, conflict management…
      - In practice, Keynes + welfare state + industrial policy =
        government acts to structure the economy
      - National rather than global system of capitalism
          - Bretton Woods regime: slow down international commerce and
            finance
  - Socialism: capitalism is based on exploitation of labor; history is
    history of class struggle
      - End goal is public ownership of means of production
      - Socialism not incompatible with markets or with democracy
  - Neoliberalism:
      - Arose from postwar boom + oil crisis, stagflation, debt crises
      - Keynesianism doesn’t work, markets are over-regulated and states
        overextended
          - So, must stabilize, privatize, deregulate →
            financialization, removal of price controls and trade
            barriers
      - Hyper-globalization, financial globalization, WTO, regional
        trade agreements, Eurozone/single market
  - Different models rooted in different ideas of human nature,
    normative frames, ideas of how markets work (self-stabilizing and
    benign vs. unstable and exploitative), conceptions of politics
  - This class responds to increasing *productive dualism* in developed
    countries – some sectors doing much better than others – which is
    normally a feature of developing countries
      - And to premature deindustrialization in the developing world
  - Populism: claim to represent “the people” + rejection of restrains
    on use of executive authority
      - Political: aversion to institutions of liberalism, independent
        courts, etc.
      - Economic: aversion to independent regulatory agencies,
        independent central bank, eternal restraints

**Unger**

  - Goal is to define the conditions of socially inclusive economic
    growth: maximum theoretical and programmatic ambition combined with
    minimum technical complication
  - Take up 3 issues:
    1.  Political context of argument, especially in North Atlantic
    2.  Address organization/alternatives to market economy (the
        foreground theme of the course)
    3.  Address character of ideas we need to pursue this (the
        background theme of the course) aimed at a redirection of the
        social sciences themselves

*Political context*

  - In politics, the last great moment of realignment was in the
    mid-20th century, post-WWII
      - Established the social democratic/social liberal consensus (in
        the US, this is the New Deal)
      - Was a bargain between forces that wanted reshaping and that
        didn’t
          - The state was allowed to regulate, attenuate inequality
            through taxes and transfers, manage the economy
            countercyclically
      - Involved a social compact between capital and labor
      - This settlement has been eroded as a result of the cumulative
        impact of:
          - The change of the dominant paradigm of production from
            industrial mass production (standardized goods and services
            produced by specialized machines), hierarchical structures,
            semi-skilled labor, factories, big corporations to the
            knowledge economy
          - The financialization of the economy: finance detached from
            the productive agenda of society
              - Sector absorbs profits, talents, human energy and
                threatens to turn finance into a bad master, not a good
                servant
          - A particular form of globalization which constrains attempts
            to create alternatives in national space
      - The combined impact has been to diminish growth and confine it
        to the fringes of a new vanguard of the knowledge economy, and
        to increase economic inequality and insecurity
      - Left-of-center and right-of-center parties have responded by
        promoting greater flexibility in labor markets – which is a
        euphemism for insecurity -\* and offering
        regulatory/redistributive compensation through taxes and social
        spending
          - This response is inadequate to master the effects of
            inequality and insecurity
          - Working people feel abandoned by their political
            representatives
          - Centrist political forces have abandoned the attempt to
            craft a strategy of socially inclusive economic growth
              - In the US today, there *is* no strategy of economic
                growth
              - The residual strategy is “cheap money,” executed by a
                central bank: expansive monetary and fiscal policy
          - This creates a vacuum into which populism has risen
      - Populism: old (benign) American conception was to defend the
        working-class interests
      - The European definition:
          - With respect to policy: solve structural problems via
            non-structural means offered in the name of the people in an
            attempt to create a new basis of division
              - On the left: monied vs. moneyless → expansion of
                redistributive entitlements
              - On the right : foreigners vs. natives → imposition of
                restraints on migration
          - With respect to political action, pushes limits of
            established institutions → Caesarism, anti-institutional
            agitation
              - Premise is that we have to choose between the
                cold/institutional and the hot/extra-institutional
                (between Madison and Mussolini)
              - Excludes idea of institutions that raise engagement in
                political life

*Organization and alternatives to the market economy*

  - In the national space, there are three themes:
      - The relation of the backward to the advanced parts of production
          - New vanguard of the knowledge economy, dedicated to
            permanent innovation but confined to fringes that exclude
            the majority of firms and workers
              - This drives stagnation and inequality
          - How do we make insular vanguardism more inclusive?
          - How do we change this rather than correct it after the fact?
      - The relation of labor to capital
          - Labor force consigned to precarious employment →
            degeneration of situation of labor vs. capital that seems
            incompatible with a sustained, inclusive rise in
            productivity
          - How do we redirect this? In the short term, address
            precarity; in the long-term, increase potential of new
            production to change the relationship between the worker and
            machine
              - Potential for a different kind of relation – will
                technology result in unemployment/underemployment
                through automation that replaces labor?
      - The relation of finance to production
          - Indifferent in good times, destructive in bad times
  - Connected to debate over globalization: imposes convergence to a
    particular kind of market economy
      - Forbids the kind of coordination that rich countries used to
        become rich
      - Enhances ability of capital to punish attempts to deviate

*Background theme: where do we get our ideas?*

  - Largely from the discipline of economics
  - But we need more than the ideas it provides to understand even
    economic problems
  - Each of the social sciences has severed the link between insight
    into the actual and the imagination of the adjacent possible

# The debates about economic growth and development

**Unger**

Today, address:

1.  Basis for takeoff of Europe, basis for all subsequent expansions of
    growth
2.  Growth “miracles” after initial takeoff
3.  Emerging debate about growth and development today

<!-- end list -->

  - Until Industrial Revolution, growth was slow and fragmented
      - Agrarian empires: Chinese, Mughal
          - There was a recurrent problem that smothered growth and
            decentralized economy
          - Divided into imperial center, landholders,
            tradespeople/workers/peasants
          - Rulers depended on success in constraining magnates: state
            needs base of taxes and recruitment
          - Characteristic policies to limit greed of magnates
          - Not squarely on the side of the people → revolution
          - Repeatedly, imperial center failed to constrain landholders
            → fell apart, invaded, market order reverted to barter
            economy
      - In Europe, pattern broken by disintegration of Roman empire
          - State formation delayed, highly fragmented with space for
            independent personalities of towns
          - Nobody planned this
          - Consequence was an irreversible level of social, cultural,
            economic pluralism
      - Development of natural science that tried to understand nature
        beyond perceptual experience
          - Counterintuitive understanding of nature
          - Object is insight into transformations of nature to be used
            for our own benefit
      - Technological innovation is endogenous to growth process
          - Technology is a materialization of the conduit between
            experiments in the transformation of nature and experiments
            in cooperation with each other
          - Based on science and depends on opening of space by
            social/economic/cultural pluralism
          - When we can express formulaically, we embody in machine
      - Underlying assumption is the relationship between
        technological/economic revolution and background/society
          - Marx: development of forces of production requires
            revolution in the mode of production
          - Illusions:
              - 1:1 relation between level of development and way of
                organizing economy
              - Deterministic: closed list of modes of production, laws
                governing their succession in history
          - In fact, there is no 1:1 relation, but there seems to be a
            direction towards greater flexibility and plasticity
              - Trust and common purpose against different backgrounds
  - Persistent elements of growth miracles: the mobilization, the
    opening, the shield. Ex: US in first half of the 19th century
      - Mobilization: never spontaneous, needs elite vision and strategy
        to mobilize national resources to the end of developing a new
        comparative advantage
          - In the US, this was Alexander Hamilton
          - War economy without a war: massive mobilization of
            resources, physical construction of country
          - Use of national debt to finance mobilization
          - Overarching and selective protectionism
      - Opening: in the 2 most important sectors, agriculture and
        finance, America had a “selective democratization” of the market
        order
          - Didn’t just regulate and attenuate retrospectively –
            innovated in legal and institutional architecture
          - In agriculture: rejected agrarian concentration, distributed
            land on frontier, strategic coordination between government
            and family to protect family farming against unique risks
            through price supports, land grant colleges, stockpiles
              - Promoted “cooperative competition,” leading to economies
                of scale
          - Finance: Andrew Jackson dissolved 2nd National Bank,
            prohibited interstate banking, created decentralized system
            of credit
          - Constraint: innovation limited by power of entrenched
            interests (the path of least resistance)
      - Shield: protect from armed and belligerent states
          - Military: alliance between armed state and national economic
            experiment
          - Commercial: engage in world economy on terms conducive to
            own national experiment
              - State must enjoy power of selectivity
              - Ex: “tiger economies” (unlike Latin American countries)
                limited foreign capital
          - Fiscal: national rebels crafting growth miracles must be
            able to resist financial interests, domestic and foreign
              - Not the vulgar Keynesianism of counter-cyclical
                management – must be subordinated to the interest of the
                shield
              - Fiscal realism not to win financial confidence, but so
                country can rebel against financial markets
              - This has contractionary effect – need to neutralize
                through private and public investment
  - Most advanced practice of production (not necessarily the most
    efficient) is the vanguard
      - Until recently, productive vanguard was industrial mass
        production
          - Context of world division of labor: capital-intensive
            production in central economies
      - Now, productive vanguard is the knowledge economy
          - Exists in every sector as the “intellectually dense”
            portion, but operates as an exclusive fringe
          - Its insular character leads to economic stagnation and
            inequality
      - New dilemma: traditional shortcut to economic growth has stopped
        working
          - Long-term growth depends on “fundamentals”: education and
            institutions
          - Shortcut: take workers and resources from less productive
            sectors and move them to the more productive sector
              - This has stopped working: consider deindustrialization
          - Why? The old vanguard is no longer the vanguard
          - Race to the bottom in terms of labor and taxes to the state
      - Alternative: socially inclusive new vanguard, but knowledge
        economy is quarantined even in richest economies with the most
        educated labor force
      - If dilemma can be broken, can be broken only by developing
        inclusive form of the new vanguard

**Rodrik**

  - Empirical facts about inequality in the knowledge economy:
      - Within firms: outsourcing/offshoring through supply chains,
        platforms/gig economy
      - Across firms: within every industry, productivity between
        leaders and laggards growing
      - Wage distribution: winners and losers in labor market are
        diverging, even for the low-skilled (paid more if associated
        with productive center)
      - Spatial: urban centers diverging from the rest
  - Secular stagnation: technological advances of today have less
    potential than 40 years ago?
      - A more straightforward explanation: the most productive
        technologies are being denied to most people, leading to a
        slowdown

**Unger**

  - Knowledge economy is multisector → shouldn’t identify it with
    platform companies and the associated network effects
  - Depends on legal/institutional arrangements – companies pay nothing
    for data generated by customers, and this is not neutral; it is an
    artifact of the legal/institutional background
  - How far can productive vanguardism extend? Reason to think it
    depends on exigent conditions, unlike mass production
      - Needs certain kind of education, accumulation of social capital
        (discretion and reciprocal trust)
      - Depends on legal/institutional innovation, alternative regimes
        of property and contract
  - Industrial policy, by contrast, essentially consists of buying a few
    more years
  - Current form of the knowledge economy is probably an example of the
    “path of least resistance”

# The challenge and opportunity presented by today’s knowledge economy

## The nature and consequences of the insular knowledge economy

**Guest speaker: Yochai Benkler**

  - Because of information asymmetries, socialized nature of
    individuals, central role of institutions, markets are pervaded by
    power
      - Social relations of production/culture, etc. are structured
        around power
      - Here, social = set of institutions and ideologies
  - Understand postwar period as a structure of social relations with
    importance placed on expertise, managerialism, Keynesianism, big
    business, unions
      - Assembly line method of production, Hollywood system of cultural
        production
  - Transition from the 1970s through the Great Recession has been
    toward self-interested individuals
      - On the right: individual rationality, on the left:
        self-actualization
      - State recedes from economy
      - Shapes how technologies get deployed, increases competition in
        labor markets, shifting power from labor to capital
      - Financialization → internationalization
  - At the macro level: readjustments in ways that redistribute power
    (not just about comparative productivity)
  - Markets invest in institutions, technology, ideology that allows
    them to extract rents
      - Horizontal power: decrease competition for their markets by
        eliminating innovators
          - Consider the App Store or Facebook – learn which apps are
            successful on the platform then introduce direct competitors
      - Vertical power: over workers, suppliers, consumers
  - Labor management platforms make sure workers are paid only when it’s
    useful for employers → this has to be backed by labor market
    institutions
      - Consider Uber’s institutional framework which enables them to
        offload all risk onto drivers
  - Increase in computational capacity, decrease in productivity growth,
    decrease in business dynamism, increase in concentration, increase
    in markups, oligarchic extraction in the 1%, wage stagnation
      - Explanation: state stepping back because of neoliberalism
  - Need to find a way to harness the state to contain the market –
    shrink the domain of the market
      - Karl Polyani: everything turns into a commodity
      - This only happens when the state removes the ability to act
        outside the market
      - Want to decommodify basic necessities: Medicare for All, public
        savings, free college, etc.
      - Goal is to alleviate imperative of selling to the market
  - Restructure power: increase antitrust, labor law, employment law,
    regulation of technology
      - Can we invert the surveillance system to create accountability?
      - Consider bodycams: initially used to subvert police authority,
        now they regularize it; they control the video, where it’s
        stored, etc.
          - This is a function of the institutional setting, not the
            technology itself
  - Socially embedding production – pre-capitalism, embedded in
    relations
      - Idea of market autonomous of social obligations is a new one
      - Sanders’ idea of worker ownership: grant 2% per year stock to
        workers
      - Recreate “what a manager needs to do” as a battle in the
        ideological sphere
  - What role can the state play to leverage fiscal power to enable
    cooperativism?
      - Quasi-utopian vision: some form of homesteading; intervention by
        state to help construct technology to produce what they need,
        embedded in social relations that use distributed materials, not
        centralized production
  - Labor-displacing vs. labor-augmenting robots? Nothing inherent in
    the technology that pushes for one or another – technology doesn’t
    develop exogenously
  - Can’t depend on the notion that the state is infallible
  - Used to be more anarchistic – skepticism about the state and the way
    it’s captured by business, military-industrial complex
      - Radical distribution of computation was first time since
        Industrial Revolution that the capital requirements of
        production were distributed in the population
      - Possibility of non-market production as an alternative to the
        market/state production
      - Seemed possible, but no historical force that would necessarily
        make it happen → political battles over laws are central
          - Copyright, DRM systems made it easier to enforce one-sided
            contracts; see this as an ideological battle
      - Focused too little on Google, Apple
          - This changed around 2008 with the introduction of platforms,
            which introduced points of control that let them recapture
            power
          - State, too: propaganda, surveillance
  - Realized that we need the sustaining, fiscal power of the state, but
    we can’t ignore elite capture

**Unger**

  - Market order is cast against social solidarity
      - Terminology of “embedding” and “re-embedding” is dangerous
  - Social relations combine power exchange and allegiance
      - “Sentimentalism of equal exchange”
      - Marx said: good riddance, we don’t want that kind of embedding
  - Unsentimental version of it: sustain high investment in people and
    capabilities, withdraw from market’s uncertainty a basic package of
    security-ensuring endowments
      - But consisted in a set of insider deals to the detriment of
        outsiders
      - We don’t want that\! We don’t want to re-embed market in social
        relations in this way
  - Three concerns:
    1.  Economic security and plasticity
    2.  Inequality: we want to change the fundamental distribution of
        advantage
    3.  Social cohesion: money transfers not adequate social cement
        (without racial/cultural homogeneity)
          - Need collective action: innovation in the economic/political
            arrangements
  - Two themes:
    1.  Knowledge economy: do firms prefer technology that extracts
        rents rather than increases productivity?
          - Another explanation: there is increased productivity in
            vanguard, but the problem is that the knowledge economy
            doesn’t spread
    2.  Market order, containment by state: but the market is not one
        thing → which market order? The market has no one form
          - Can we change the market order by innovating in fundamental
            legal mechanisms?

## The alternative futures of the knowledge economy

**Rodrik**

  - Techno-optimists say the 3rd and 4th industrial revolutions are
    comparable to the 1st and 2nd, and that the benefits can be broadly
    shared with enough investment in skills
  - Techno-pessimists say the scale is not comparable to the 1st and
    2nd, and that its application is limited to a few sectors, which
    drives inequality and joblessness
  - In development:
      - The optimists say that the rapid diffusion of technology aids
        developing countries
      - The pessimists say that skill and capital intensity and the
        high-quality institutions/regulations required make it hard for
        developing countries to catch up
  - Evidence?
      - Slowdown and compartmentalization of productivity growth, gap
        between leading and lagging firms, widening spatial/regional
        divides
      - Gap between productivity and wages (especially for
        nonsupervisory workers)
      - Premature deindustrialization in developing countries (because
        of globalization and skill-intensive technical progress in
        manufacturing)
  - Determinants of technological innovation:
      - What questions are asked and whose problems are solved – this is
        what social choice is about\! Technology isn’t exogenous
      - Economics: R\&D costs are private but benefits are social, leads
        to market failure
          - Hence, innovation support: subsidies, patent protection,
            seed funding, etc.
      - Priorities shape support policies – what counts as R\&D, which
        innovations are patentable, etc.
      - Firms prefer innovations that can be monopolized, raise entry
        barriers, enhance control over workers, have costs/risks that
        can be shifted onto others
      - Unlikely to invest in innovations with social externalities
      - “High-road strategies”: technology for benefit of workers/public
        as opposed to pure profit/productivity
          - Is there a “win-win”? Is it in the interest of firms to have
            happy workers?
          - No reason to think that these incentives are universal or
            sufficiently strong, especially because of coordination
            failures
      - The internalized norm is that technological progress is
        synonymous with saving on labor

**Unger**

  - Foreground theme: future of knowledge economy, which is a set of
    practices associated with potential that presently is suppressed
      - Division of labor: production at scale with
        destandardization/customization
      - Momentum in production combined with decentralization of
        initiative
      - Potential to relax constraint of diminishing marginal returns
      - Revolution in moral culture of production: replace low-trust
        command and control structure with more reciprocal trust and
        individual initiative
      - Make activity of producing more like activity of discovering
      - Coordination of machine and anti-machine (human being)
  - Background theme: how to achieve inclusive growth?
      - Need to reckon with disappointment: we had a burst of scientific
        and technological development that promised exponential growth,
        but instead we have stagnation and inequality
  - Three steps to argument:
    1.  Causation of disappointment
    2.  Aspects of programmatic response
    3.  Level of transformative ambitions

*Causation of disappointment*

  - Want to contrast 3 narratives. The first two are the most
    influential, and these RMU will argue against

<!-- end list -->

1.  Narrative of automation: technological dynamism has run away from us
      - Internal logic of technology is that it replaces labor instead
        of augmenting it
      - Thus, the best we can do is social compensation – e.g. a minimum
        guaranteed income
      - Objection: it has never happened before that technological
        advances diminish employment – this is a “lump-sum” fallacy
          - Technological evolution is indeterminate: it doesn’t have a
            single form, it is *shaped*
          - Whether it replaces or compensates labor depends on what we
            do
      - The response suggested by this narrative has no relation to the
        supply side of production. It doesn’t give people good jobs
2.  Narrative of exhaustion: contemporary technology is inherently less
    fertile
      - Have we exhausted the low-hanging fruit?
      - Seems like AI, computational biology, etc. have vast potential
      - Repair to Keynesianism: expansionary fiscal and monetary policy
          - But no organic, proximate connection to modern production,
            c.f. road-building in the New Deal which had a direct
            connection to the automobile industry
3.  Transformation narrative: sustained growth requires breakthroughs on
    both the supply and demand sides, and there is no automatic
    correspondence between the two
      - Keynes is not actually a general theory, it is specific to Great
        Depression
      - Supply side: lift up retrograde businesses and backwards parts
        of industry by giving them access to advanced technological
        practices and to markets
          - Reach individuals too – vast parts of the parts of the labor
            force are in insecure/precarious employment, the middle
            class has been hollowed out
          - Need to reach those detached from large firms: nurse
            practitioners, IT support
          - Transform into “technologically equipped artisans” – not
            just skills, but support
          - Then go down to lower part of labor market – janitors,
            shelf-stackers
          - Then up the ladder to medicine, law, engineering
      - Prioritize things that give access to advanced practices, power
        to share/manage assets in enterprises where they work
      - In the U.S., need to refinance the state – the aggregate tax
        take is at least 10% lower in Europe, which is incompatible with
        reconstruction
          - Only way to do this is an indirect/regressive tax on
            consumption, which will be “gained back” (in terms of
            undoing the regressivity) on the spending side
          - Progressives don’t like this – they are against *all*
            regressive taxation
      - Demand side: prefer distribution of assets to democratization of
        credit
          - Aspiration to property-owning democracy was replaced with
            credit democracy, which led to the crisis of 2008
          - Can’t have sustained expansion based on popularization of
            debt not backed up by sharing of assets
          - Can’t replace labor power with tax-and-transfer – labor
            needs share in power, protection against insecurity, and a
            share of assets

*Focus on programmatic response: one aspect of supply side*

  - Need a project of inclusive transformation
  - What determines if we will break from business as usual? Education
    and access to the means of production
      - Education: knowledge economy has demanding requirements, general
        and technical
          - Prioritize depth over breadth, cooperation over
            individualism, dialectical practice
          - Quality can’t depend on geography or circumstance, which
            necessitates federal standards
      - Access to means of production has 3 stages:
        1.  Broaden access to larger range of agents (firms and
            individuals) – need a decentralized procedure to discover
            what works
        2.  Need a different institutional architecture
              - Not American model of arm’s-length regulation
              - Not northeast Asian model of industrial policy imposed
                top down
              - Need a third form: collaboration to the end of
                disseminating advanced practices
        3.  Experiments with property and contract law need to be able
            to coexist in some market order

*Relation of structural to fragmentary change*

  - Programmatic proposal should: (1) mark a direction and (2) select
    initial steps to move in that direction
  - Constituency can’t be just the historical constituency of the left:
    organized labor in capital-intensive production
  - Instead, need to build base, must include 4 elements:
    1.  Workers in traditional capital-intensive sectors
    2.  Precarious workers
    3.  Small business class
    4.  Rank-and-file of professional business class (which is
        increasingly separate from plutocratic elite)
  - Unifying theme: become bigger together by remaking institutional
    arrangements of the economy and the state

# The market order and its reconstruction

## Economics, institutions, and the possibility of alternative institutional forms of the market economy

**Rodrik**

  - Do contemporary market economies depend on a particular form of
    institutions?
  - Institutions are the “rules of the game in a society”
      - Formal: law, regulations
      - Informal: norms, patterns, moral codes
      - Not organizations in the sense that they don’t need a physical
        form
  - A functional typology of market-supporting institutions:
      - Market-creating: property rights, contract enforcement
      - Market-regulating: antitrust, environment/safety regulations,
        labor market institutions, “industrial policies” = correction of
        market/coordination failure
      - Market-stabilizing: monetary, fiscal, currency arrangements =
        macroeconomic management
      - Market-legitimizing: redistribution, social insurance, political
        democracy
  - Don’t want to mistakenly associate these functions with forms:
    there’s no unique mapping between the two because of local
    specificity
      - Ex: macroeconomic stability doesn’t necessarily imply
        independent central banks
  - We have an objective like productive efficiency (static and dynamic)
      - That implies certain universal principles: property rights,
        incentives, the rule of law
      - But not particular arrangements: what type of property rights?
        Is there a role for industrial policy?
  - Economics can elaborate the link between these universal principles
    and institutional arrangements

**Unger**

  - Institutions are norms, rules, and standards that govern practice in
    a particular dimension of social life, informed by concepts of what
    those relations can and should be like in that domain
  - Importantly, they are not *things*. This distinction means:
      - The arrangements are mediated by representations (ideas) about
        what the relations can and should be like
          - Law is the institutional form of the life of the people
      - They tilt the scale of experience in a particular direction
          - C.f. liberal political thinking, in which the aspiration is
            to form a framework of rights that is neutral with respect
            to sectarian visions of the “good”
          - But every institutional order encourages and discourages
            particular forms of relations and social life
          - There is no neutral – and this concept is dangerous because
            it is usually invoked in defense of entrenched ideas
          - But neutrality is the perverted (false, dangerous) form of
            the idea that society should be open and corrigible in the
            light of experience. These are the legitimate counterparts
            to the idea of neutrality
      - They are artifacts in that we made them; we should thus try to
        understand them from the inside, not from the outside as we do
        natural phenomena
          - They are a kind of “frozen politics”: the ordinary struggle
            of politics is temporarily interrupted and contained in
            institutions
      - They are not univocal: they exist “more or less”
          - They can be organized to insulate themselves against
            challenge and change
              - Then they appear to be facts about the universe – Marx
                and Hegel described them as the “alienated parts of
                ourselves”
          - Or we can organize them so they revise themselves
  - In economics, the most important debate is about the institutional
    form of the market economy
      - In the 19th century, both Marxists and conservative jurists
        shared the belief that the market order has built-in
        institutional content: you buy the whole package
          - This is the Marxist conception that capitalism is a system
            with a predefined architecture
      - But when you try to determine the architecture of the market
        economy from first principles, there are choices to be made
          - The market has no single, natural, necessary legal form
          - This was the main achievement of legal theory from approx.
            1850-1950, exemplified in the US by Oliver Wendell Holmes
      - This idea – that the market doesn’t have a natural form – can be
        inferred at the most abstract level. There are 2 aspects of a
        market order:
        1.  The absolute level of economic decentralization (the number
            of agents entitled to bargain)
        2.  The absoluteness of control over resources (are property
            rights eternal, hereditary, etc.)
              - Unified property rights are an invention of the 19th
                century
              - In most legal traditions, the normal form of property
                rights involves a disaggregation of the component parts,
                invested in various stakeholders
              - This control can be fragmentary, relative, limited, and
                temporary
      - Conservative thinking usually postulates that decentralization
        and control go together, but the first can be advanced by
        limiting the latter
  - How has economics approached the problem of the institutional form
    of the market? In three main ways:
    1.  “Pure” economics: started by the marginalist theorists of the
        19th century and achieved by the general equilibrium theorists
        of the mid-20th century
          - Free of any institutional message – it is a form of logic,
            an analytical apparatus
          - Can be applied to a command economy, which implies that the
            choice among these systems is a political one
    2.  “Fundamentalist” economics: the market order does have a legal
        and institutional form (this is precisely the idea that the
        19th-century jurists subverted)
          - Associated with ideas of Hayek: if Robinson Crusoe traded
            for long enough, he would reproduce the entire 19th-century
            system of German private law
    3.  “Equivocating” economics: exemplified by the American followers
        of Keynes who rendered his doctrines palatable by defanging them
          - Seeks to establish law-like correlations between large-scale
            economic aggregates, e.g. the Phillips curve
          - People challenge them by saying that these correlations
            depend on institutional details (like unemployment insurance
            or other social benefits); if the institutions change, then
            the correlations fall apart
              - But they can disregard these challenges by conceding the
                point and claiming that they are just doing analysis in
                the status quo
          - They confuse stability and stagnation with lawfulness
  - Placing this in the context of the history of ideas:
      - Classical European social theory (Marxism) had a structural
        bent: to distinguish the surface from the regime that shapes
        routines and conflicts
      - But they surrounded this instinct with deterministic illusions
        that corrupted it; for example, within Marxism, the ideas that:
          - There is a closed list of basic regimes (modes of
            production): capitalism, feudalism, socialism, etc.
          - Each of these is a complete individual system
              - This means there are only 2 types of politics: reformist
                management and revolution
              - It excludes change that is structural but piecemeal
          - There are laws governing the succession of these regimes:
            history has a project, therefore we don’t need one
      - Contemporary social theory and policy has abolished structural
        ideas, which results in naturalizing the established
        arrangements and presenting them as the outcome of “best
        practice”
      - Thus, we currently have no usable idea of structural
        change/structural alternatives
  - Addressing DR’s proposal of universal principles: they are a
    (mistaken) attempt to find a middle ground between pure economics,
    which is impotent, and fundamentalist/equivocating economics, which
    are powerful but corrupted
      - They try to take something off the table, with the idea that
        this is uncontroversial, that everyone can agree – but RMU
        doesn’t
      - Moreover, the world doesn’t. So is the world ill-advised? RMU
        says no
      - Example: does the goal of productive efficiency imply the rule
        of law and property rights?
          - The world seems to say no
          - Differential mastery of rules about property means that some
            groups manipulate them better than others, which leads to
            (sometimes violent) redistribution
          - Who will have property? And what are the benefits they get?
              - Every tax on capital is a debate about this
              - Should investors be rewarded, or stakeholders (workers)
                too? This is not a settled question
              - Consider the law of restitution and unjust enrichment –
                should people be rewarded if they do something to enrich
                others, even if this wasn’t in a contract ex ante?
      - Another example: does the goal of macroeconomic and financial
        stability imply “sound money” policies (i.e. don’t generate
        liquidity in excess of money demand?)
          - The right wing disagrees with this principle: they say the
            only effective way to achieve this objective is to have a
            metallic base for money
          - This is the neoclassical synthesis: Keynesian economics
            downsized (macroeconomics) and superimposed on marginalist
            economic theory (microeconomics)
          - Progressives say the principle of sound money is a principle
            for a world that no longer exists
              - Today, we’re closer to the world Keynes was writing
                about: there are large pools of liquid capital being
                hoarded, underinvestment
      - Final example: does the goal of distributive justice and poverty
        alleviation imply targeting and universality?
          - Aren’t these principle and counter-principle? You can
            justify anything with this
          - The European social democrats and FDR rejected targeting in
            favor of universal programs; LBJ began targeting with his
            war on poverty
              - This turned out to be harmful for the poor because in
                political/economic downturns, the benefits can be turned
                off or downsized
          - Universality is a social compact with normative content; it
            should be privileged over the principle of targeting
  - Five theses for thinking about alternative institutions:
    1.  We need to liberate ourselves from the 19th-century idea of both
        liberals and socialists that there is a predetermined harmony
        between the institutional requirements for the development of
        productive power (i.e. “forces of production”) and the
        liberation from hierarchy, especially class struggle
          - Today, we risk a dogmatic pessimism: that there is an
            insoluble contradiction between these things
          - But there is a zone of potential overlap in which we seek to
            find institutional content specific to our context
    2.  The focus of ideological controversy is changing: before, it was
        the market vs. the state, but now we need to find alternative
        forms of economic/social pluralism that go beyond the North
        Atlantic social democratic vision
    3.  We should have a special interest in the deepening and diffusion
        of the most advanced productive practice which today is the
        knowledge economy
          - This means promoting a high-energy democracy and an
            education system that allows individuals both to resist
            their context and operate within it
    4.  We want institutions that are denaturalized, not ones that
        resist challenge and change
          - We want structural alternatives, not a structural dogmatism
          - We want to deny our institutions the “last word”
    5.  We need to be attentive to a particular dialectic: we want to
        make the individual secure in a haven of safeguards and
        endowments, which we do by taking these off the table in
        day-to-day politics under a rhetoric of “fundamental rights”
          - But the purpose of this arrangement is to throw everything
            in society and economy open to change
          - The liberal discourse has the first but not the second
          - We need to figure out how to institutionally arrange for
            that “storm” of change

## The market order and inequality: the contrast between corrective redistribution and institutional change influencing the primary distribution of economic advantage

**Rodrik**

  - Contrast redistribution through tax-and-transfer with changing
    institutions that influence economy
  - Rise in inequality in Europe looks more moderate than in US
      - Why? Technology and globalization trends are the same
          - Way economy is organized, more extensive role of state…
      - Difference shows how institutions and policies moderate
        globalization and technological shocks
  - Three stages:
    1.  Pre-production: people enter economy with endowments (networks,
        education, access to financial capital)
    2.  Production: system of production creates market outcomes,
        produces income/wealth distribution
    3.  Post-production
    <!-- end list -->
      - Can distinguish policies that act at these stages
          - Ex: education, UBI are pre-production
          - Taxes are post-production
      - Productivist policies intervene directly in stage of production,
        employment, innovation
  - Three targets:
    1.  Help people at the bottom
    2.  Address wealth concentration at the top
    3.  Target middle class insecurity, precarity
  - Traditional focus: investment in health, public education
    (pre-production) and redistribution, social safety net
    (post-production)
      - Increasing discussion of policies that target production
  - Focus on productivist policies addressing middle class: “good jobs”
      - Good jobs: secure employment with benefits, give workers sense
        of satisfaction
      - 3 categories:
        1.  Address productivity of existing jobs and firms
        2.  Increase number of good jobs by supporting startups,
            expansion; attract investment from firms elsewhere
              - Currently takes place in distorted form: tax subsidies
                create “race to the bottom”
        3.  Workforce development programs, continuous investment in
            skills
  - Kind of industrial policy: government intervenes to affect structure
    of production and direction of technological change
      - Traditional type (East Asian model of industrialization):
        top-down incentives – promote specific sectors (shipbuilding,
        steel), use specific instruments (export, credit subsidies)
          - Presumes ex-ante knowledge and competence on part of public
            agencies
      - More contemporary: ongoing processes, strategic collaboration
        across levels. Design principles:
        1.  Embeddedness: knowledge embedded in activities of
            participants
        2.  Institutional capacity: ability to revise policy
        3.  Clear benchmarks of what constitutes success
        4.  Broader accountability
  - Four advantages of this way of thinking:
    1.  Structural approach: focuses directly on employment
          - Transition away from welfare state model
    2.  Little market/state dichotomy
    3.  No dichotomy between equity and efficiency
    4.  Dichotomy between reform and revolution also disappears

**Unger**

*Philosophical prelude*

  - How should we think about inequality? Ideological debate of last two
    centuries: “shallow equality” vs. “shallow freedom”
      - Left gives priority to equality, right gives priority to freedom
  - “Shallow” because they are pursued against background of established
    institutional arrangement
  - Theories of distributive justice (e.g. Rawls)
      - On their face, seem radically egalitarian
      - But they are philosophical prop to compensatory redistribution
      - Attempts to achieve equality via redistribution after the fact
        are limited
      - Pragmatic residue: attempt to attenuate inequality generated in
        the market through retrospective tax-and-transfer
  - Alternatives? Deep equality: give priority to equality of
    outcome/circumstance
      - “We’re all poor, but we’re poor together”
          - Not our aim
  - Deep freedom: Bring experience of ordinary people to higher level of
    intensity, scope, capability
      - Struggle against inequality is subsidiary to this larger
        objective
      - Narrower and deeper than equality of opportunity
      - Equality of *empowerment* – opportunity to act
      - Conservatives say it is natural for life to be small –
        exceptions are heroes, thinkers, saints, entrepreneurs
      - Progressives: become bigger only if we become bigger together
          - Resist inequality because it is a constraint on this shared
            empowerment
          - Method: structural change in institutional arrangements,
            ideological assumptions
              - Necessarily piecemeal

*Historical prelude*

  - In medium to long term, equality *among* nations affected most by
    diffusion of most advanced practice of production
      - Short term, migration
  - Long term, equality *within* nations affected most by ability to
    share in most advanced practice of production
      - Short to medium term, war
      - How can we achieve war economy without a war?
        1.  Growth: massive mobilization of national resources
        2.  Plasticity: large-scale mobilization together with radical
            institutional innovation
              - Create economic and political institutions that
                facilitate their own revision
        3.  Solidarity: elites recognize that sacrifices must be
            rewarded
              - Peacetime equivalent: multiplication of forms of
                collective action within and outside the economy

*Relation of production to equality*

  - Two options: diminish inequality by correcting inequalities
    generated in present market order; or diminish inequality by
    innovating in arrangements that shape fundamental distribution of
    advantage
      - Initiatives that affect primary distribution have more promise
        than attempt to correct after-the-fact
      - If we attempt to correct after the fact, we establish tension
        between established economic incentives and egalitarian
        commitment: “equity vs. efficiency”
      - This idea conflicts with certain orthodoxy
          - Piketty compares direct redistribution (e.g. mandate higher
            return to labor by increasing nominal wage) to fiscal
            redistribution
              - Says undermines price system as system for efficient
                allocation of resources
              - Direct redistribution results in less employment,
                preference for substitution of labor by capital
          - But doesn’t consider extent to which fiscal redistribution
            can disorganize the real economy
  - In influencing primary distribution, three elements have priority:
    1.  Status of labor vis-a-vis capital
          - Need different legal regime to reconcile genuine flexibility
            in labor market with security
          - Future of wage labor as predominant form of free work (c.f.
            self-employment and cooperation)
          - Consequence of evolution of technology for substitution of
            labor
    2.  Empowerment through productive uplift
          - Cooperative competition among producers
          - Aid to middle part of job distribution
    3.  Education
          - Character/quality of general education: form of education
            that can empower, prefer selective depth to encyclopedic
            superficiality, approach all subjects dialectically
          - Technical/vocational training: analytic/technical
            capabilities rather than job- or machine-specific skills

*Relation of innovation in primary distribution to after-the-fact
corrective policies*

  - Three principles:
    1.  Change in arrangements that shape primary distribution has
        priority over attempts to correct after-the-fact
    2.  Common mistake: separate revenue and spending side and focus on
        progressive profile of revenue
          - Paradox: among rich industrial democracies of North
            Atlantic, the one that on paper has most progressive tax
            system is US
              - Relies on taxing personal income
              - European social democracies based on regressive/indirect
                taxation of consumption (VAT)
          - In the short run, what matters most for overall
            redistributive effect is *aggregate* tax take and how it is
            spent
          - Progressive taxation has marginal effect on inequality, but
            politicians’ commitment to progressive taxation at election
            time becomes device to show who’s side they are on
    3.  Role for progressive redistributive taxation
          - Two targets: hierarchy of standards of living, accumulation
            of economic power
          - Progressive income tax hits neither squarely
          - Which instrument hits first target? Individualized
            consumption tax
              - Nicholas Kaldor: The Expenditure Tax
              - Take aggregate income (labor and capital) and subtract
                invested savings; tax this difference on steeply
                progressive slope
          - Second target: tax system reaches more bluntly
              - Tax hereditary transfer of property
  - Central theme: equality without empowerment is a failed program

## The relation between finance and the real economy as a context for reshaping the market order

**Unger**

  - Three themes today:
    1.  Present coronavirus crisis as a transformative opportunity
    2.  Relation of finance to real economy, financial instability to
        economic breakdown
    3.  Develop second discussion in an application to the nature,
        causes, and consequences of 2008 crisis
  - Two major themes of class have been: (1) alternative institutional
    forms that market economy can take and (2) evolution of productive
    apparatus of society, in particular, the most advanced practice of
    production and its relation to rest of economy
      - Frequently referred to idea of a “war economy without a war”
      - History has handed us an astonishing and unwanted example of
        this problem
      - We have a crisis that in some respects evokes idea of war
        economy – many political leaders referred to this concept
      - It is (should be) a war economy in the emergency production of
        medical equipment
          - State is source of both demand and supply
      - But in a larger sense, this is the inverse of a war economy
          - A radical breakdown in supply and demand where the major
            part of labor force is sent home
  - Transformative response to this problem in 4 areas:
    1.  Income of workers
    2.  Skills of labor force
    3.  Revenue of businesses
    4.  Organization of emergency production
  - Propose thought experiment: consider what a progressive political
    force would do in response to this emergency if it had the
    institutional and productivist focus that almost all existing
    progressive forces lack
      - Conception of what could happen if we had the right ideas and
        the right will
  - Preliminary: who will pay for it? Initiatives require a large amount
    of money
      - If ever there were a circumstance in which state has no narrow
        public finance constraints, this is it
      - All of this spending would represent replacement income and
        revenue
      - So a great deal could be spent without provoking inflationary
        spiral
      - State could finance initiatives by creating money – increasing
        or monetizing public debt
  - Income of workers: state has to guarantee large part of wage that
    workers no longer earn
      - Same principle must apply to self-employed or semi-employed
        workers
      - Medium to long term: opportunity to experiment with insurance
        against “black swan” risks – radicalize, generalize principle of
        social security
  - Skills of labor force: opportunity to use crisis to increase skills
    of labor force
      - Network with each other within and outside firms
      - Long term – not just boost to productivity, increase in extent
        to which workers are independent from firms
  - Business revenue: governments around the world propose to guarantee
    revenue
      - Should not be uncompensated – demand reform to executive
        remuneration, increase in workers’ rights
  - Emergency production: specific corner of this problem in which
    example of war economy is most apposite
      - Governor of NY: propose medical supply chain be nationalized,
        President resisted: “nationalization is a bad concept”
      - War Production Act 1950 gives wide powers to federal government
        to direct businesses to produce what needs to be produced
          - Point of departure for innovative institutional engineering
          - Not just centralized direction of production, but
            development of public-private partnerships to work in areas
            that don’t correspond to short-term demands, but to
            long-term strategic imperatives
  - No insuperable technical, financial, economic or legal obstacle
      - Obstacles are fundamentally political and ideological – ideas
        and will

**Rodrik**

  - Agree that crisis is not one that poses significant
    technical/intellectual challenges
      - Puzzle is why so much of the world is failing at meeting those
        challenges
      - Many of ideas have not percolated up
      - Massive problem of social cooperation and coordination, not just
        ideas and will
  - Alternative thought experiment: imagine US had taken threat
    seriously – testing kits employed, federal government had invested
    in widespread testing, would have enabled us to tell who was
    infected → enabled us to quarantine those who are infected
      - Only stay home 2 weeks → 1.5% GDP lost
      - Instead, we have supply shock with spillover into demand side
      - Now estimate Great Depression levels of unemployment
      - South Korea taken an approach closer to the one here
          - Deployed widespread testing and social distancing very
            rapidly
          - Not an authoritarian state, so this is possible in democracy
  - Traditional Keynesian approach won’t work – we have a supply shock
    (ask people to stay home), so significant fall in GDP is inevitable
    (part of needed public health response)
      - What we can do is support income
      - Britain/Germany: firms being paid to keep workers employed
  - Uncertainty about crisis → supply shock creating induced demand
    shock
      - Even if paid 80% of salary, uncertainty about future → consumers
        don’t want to spend a lot money
      - So, needs to be significant Keynesian action to increase
        aggregate demand
      - Particularly with respect to medical supplies
          - Hard to understand why federal government is not directly
            requisitioning medical materials from suppliers
          - Letting states compete with each other
  - Failure of global cooperation
      - WHO could have played much bigger role
      - Arguably greater need for cooperation in public health than in
        economics (IMF, OECD)
  - Failure of many political systems to produce leadership and response
    makes DR skeptical that we can envisage bridge to productivist
    agenda
      - Optimistic side: no longer take for granted social/economic
        arrangements, role of the state, prevailing nature of ideas –
        opening for the kinds of things we’ve been discussing

**Unger**

  - Promise of interaction between bold governmental initiative and
    cooperation/social organization
  - Disposition to cooperate is influenced by culture
      - But not just a constant
  - Emergency production of needed medical equipment: cooperation
    becomes essential
      - Ex: Automobile factories don’t immediately know how to produce
        ventilators
  - Capacious view: not just the state acting unilaterally, rather
    creating opportunities for cooperative breakthroughs

**Rodrik**

  - Question of how we’re going to pay for this doesn’t arise
      - Low interest rate environment already
  - Supply side crisis might generate inflationary pressure, but we
    haven’t seen that
      - Induced demand side effects are playing a role in dampening
        inflation expectations
      - Not a time to be fiscally conservative
  - Fair amount of consensus:
      - Income support, support demand, invest in medical supply chain,
        increase capacity at hospitals, backstop financial system
        (happening through ECB and Fed), work with small and medium
        businesses to ensure they have resources
      - Much of debate is about practicalities of that
  - Can we just print money?
  - **Rodrik:** As long as you have a use for it, as long as it doesn’t
    increase inflation
      - Inflation is the sign you’re running into a resource constraint
      - As long as inflationary expectations and inflation are low,
        that’s a sign you can increase supply of money (“helicopter
        money”)
      - Not a big difference between traditional economics and MMT on
        this front
  - **Unger:** Distinction between two levels
      - One level: money created by state is being used to replace
        personal income/business revenue
          - In principle, you can go a long way without provoking
            inflation
      - Second level: inflation becomes functional equivalent of a tax
          - Intervening in distributive conflict with advantages and
            disadvantages
          - Historically, one way states have managed distributive
            conflict
  - **Rodrik:** Even in first level, loss in income is happening because
    people are not working
      - If we give them income, it’s income that has no counterpart in
        real production
      - Immediately find ourselves in second phase – we cannot give them
        real income, only can give income by taking purchasing power
        away from someone else
      - But this is not the situation we’re in because no increase in
        inflationary expectations
      - Loss in income to workers generated by loss of expenditures
        (reduction of demand) – but we’ve generated supply shock by
        asking people to stay at home
          - So there’s an element that can’t be compensated by giving
            people more money
          - Unless you find a way to increase production
  - **Unger:** Continuing dispute with DR, “if it’s already hard to
    reach the minimum, why are you asking for the maximum?” → need to
    have higher transformative ambition to deal with basics
  - **Rodrik:** Interpret this as: “Why make it difficult if you can
    make it impossible?”
  - **Unger:** Need interaction between state initiative and
    mobilization of organized civil society
      - Historical reality is that interaction cannot happen in an
        atmosphere of programmatic minimalism
      - Only happens when there’s a transformative campaign

**Rodrik**

  - Share of financial industry profits as total business, share of
    finance in US GDP, stock market trading volume over GDP, all up
  - Prior to global financial crisis, extraordinary scale: Ireland,
    Iceland (acting as hedge fund with stocks of financial assets and
    liabilities 10x GDP)
  - One would expect that some good would come out of financialization
      - Narrative behind financial liberalization, deregulation,
        globalization is that they produce benefits
          - Within economy: diversification of risk, distribution of
            risk from those who do not have ability to bear it to those
            who do
              - Enable access to homeownership to larger segments of
                population
          - Globally: transfer financial resources from rich countries
            to poor countries
      - World would experience boom in private investment and growth
        while experiencing reduction in overall volatility
          - Those expectations have not been borne out
          - No increase in real resources devoted to investment in
            developing or advanced countries
              - If anything, private investment has stagnated
  - Left with deep disconnect between finance and real economy
      - At best, a source of consumption support for parts of the middle
        class
      - Spurred homeownership, but in a way that created systemic risk
        and financial distress
      - Exception: moments of crisis, central banks act as lenders of
        last resort to commercial banking sector, parts of real economy
          - This morning: Fed preparing credit facility for lending to
            small and medium sized enterprise
  - “Smart” development banking
      - Out of fashion – many countries closed down
      - Finance long-term investment in environments where not available
        through normal commercial means
      - Complemented with another role: intelligence gathering, where
        are there opportunities for new investments?
          - Tightly connected to productive opportunities in private
            sector
          - Make intelligence available to the state and other parts of
            private sector
  - Public venture funds
      - Governments can borrow at very low interest rates → set up
        quasi-independent venture funds, managed independently, take
        ownership shares in startups or firms investing in new
        technologies
      - Direct investment towards employment-enhancing or green
        technologies

**Unger**

4 sets of comments:

  - Locate discussion of finance in general idea of economic instability
      - 2 fundamental causes of instability
        1.  Absence of spontaneous/automatic correspondence between
            supply and demand
              - Keynes concerned with one version – violation of Say’s
                Law, aggravated by downward rigidity of wage
              - But there are many ways supply and demand can fail to be
                connected
        2.  Troubled relation of finance to real economy
              - Keynes: came out of psychological tradition of English
                political economy
              - Liquidity of money balances allow them to serve as
                plaything of waves of elation, despondency, greed, and
                fear
              - But this is a limited and inadequate understanding of a
                more general phenomenon
  - Orthodox way of thinking about finance, and what’s missing from it
      - Orthodoxy: If there is a problem with finance, originates in
        failure of competition in capital market (such as asymmetry of
        information) or in failure of regulatory response to localized
        market failure
          - Under this view, makes no sense to say finance is more/less
            closely related to productive agenda of society
          - This selective blindness is an example of the false
            assumption that market economy has single natural, necessary
            form
          - When Americans in first half of 19th century disbanded
            national bank and created most decentralized system of
            credit that had ever existed, they were creating
            institutional arrangements that tightened relationship of
            finance to real economy, not simply regulating
  - Conventional way of thinking cannot elucidate some things:
      - Under existing arrangements of market economy, production system
        is largely self-financed on basis of retained, reinvested
        private earnings
          - What is the point of money in banks and stock markets?
          - Vast amount of financial activity has oblique relation to
            production
      - Under these arrangements, finance is relatively indifferent to
        real economy in good times, destructive in bad times
          - When things are going well, productive system largely
            finances itself
          - In times of trouble, distress spills over into real economy
      - In principle, most important responsibility of finance: fund
        productive agenda of society, fund creation of new assets in new
        ways
          - Turns out to be miniscule part of financial activity
          - Venture capital, even in U.S, where it is most established,
            represents less than 0.5% of financial activity
      - Explanation: structure/arrangements that leave finance
        disconnected from production
          - Best way to make it less dangerous is to make it more useful
  - Programmatic horizon: What can we do?
      - Negatively: discourage or prohibit financial activities that
        have no relation to enhancement of production or productivity
          - Options, derivatives contracts increase liquidity in
            commodity markets but not clear they have a similar role in
            equity markets → turn into instrument of gambling
      - Positively: channel finance into productive investment
          - Smart investment banks, quasi-public venture funds are
            examples of this
          - Pension systems could be placed in diversified portfolios of
            risk that would do the undone work of venture capital
  - Connect to crisis of 2008. Conventional response to crisis
    emphasized stimulus (Keynesianism) and re-regulation of finance
      - Causal background of crisis – what was origin of problem?
          - Most fundamental origin: country stopped producing enough
            goods and services that rest of world wanted
      - Masked absence of productivist project with form of economic
        growth led by mass consumption
          - In principle, requires democratization of purchasing power –
            but in late 20th century, violently regressive
            redistribution of wealth
              - How to reconcile cheap money and debt/credit with
                regressive wealth/income?
              - Replace property-owning democracy with fake credit
                economy, made possible in part by overvaluation of
                housing stock as collateral
          - Enabled by structural imbalances in world economy – debt and
            credit style of growth financed by export of Chinese
            financial and trade surpluses
              - Each country used structural imbalance to escape
                imperative of structural change
              - Americans escaped need for productivist project and need
                to distribute assets to uplift production/democratize
                demand
              - Chinese replaced imperative of deepening internal market
                with style of growth based on exports to deficit-ridden
                US
      - Aggravated by regulatory approach (left untouched by response to
        2008): regulatory dualism
          - Densely regulated area of finance where public moved (ex:
            FDIC), thinly regulated area supposedly populated by
            professionals who could take care of themselves
          - Everything that was prohibited in densely regulated area
            repackaged and done under different label in thinly
            regulated area
      - Response to crisis left whole causal background almost entirely
        untouched
          - Didn’t develop productivist project, didn’t disturb
            regulatory dualism

**Rodrik**

  - Revisit housing markets pre-2008. The narrative behind the credit
    market bubble in housing finance was one that was on the consumption
    side of the economy – not directly productivist – but story meant to
    be in line with social objective of increasing homeownership
      - Who wouldn’t want financial markets to serve homeownership?
      - Why don’t we introduce real competition into mortgage lending →
        take it out of hands out of monopoly of mainline banks, allow
        non-banks to make mortgage loans → create more access
          - Also, deregulate so intermediaries can offer creative,
            affordable mortgages
      - Worried about risk? Pool and package them into securities → farm
        them off to investors
          - Divvy up stream of payments into tranches, compensating
            holders of riskier ones, call on credit rating industries to
            certify that less risky ones are safe, then create
            derivatives to allow investors to purchase insurance (credit
            default swap)
      - Story is compelling – financial innovation, increased
        competition, new intermediaries, new assets expanding benefits
        of middle-class homeownership
  - Possible to see through tools of conventional economics that
    something was going to go wrong
      - Incentives create tremendous leverage, tendency for excessive
        risk taking not being internalized
      - Cautionary note: ensure that financial innovation is disciplined
        by economics

**Unger**

  - One aspect of what happened in this story: mortgage market came out
    of New Deal, most powerful device for deepening of capital markets
      - Organized through ingenious institutions – Freddie Mac, Fannie
        Mae (quasi-public)
  - Late 20th century: securitization of mortgage market under the
    pretext of increasing competition
      - But became device of speculation disconnected from economic
        reality
      - Layers of financial engineering – transactions of real economy,
        rather than being subject of engineering, became simply the
        pretext
  - Inequality increasing in US despite broad-based mass consumption
      - Inequality + cheap money → asset bubbles
  - What’s the regulatory response? 4 sets of programs
    1.  Resurrection of New Deal policies and rules separating
        investment banks from regular banks
    2.  New supervisory, liquidating authority in federal government
        (deal with too big to fail problem)
    3.  International finance: new standards of capital adequacy
    4.  New standards for consumer protection
  - None of these things dealt with regulatory dualism and separation
    from real economy → complete failure
      - Now, new crisis against background of old failure
  - Every time we try regulatory dualism, the same thing happens: we
    repackage all the things that are prohibited in thickly regulated
    sector and do them in the thinly regulated one
  - Something like half of graduating class of Harvard College go into
    finance and management consulting
      - Pushing paper, gambling, rather than investing, making things,
        doing real things in the world
      - Absorbing leviathan proportion of profits, perverting and
        misdirecting the intellectual energies of the nation
  - Q: How do we reconcile nationalization with decentralized
    production?
  - **Rodrik:** Nationalization is a question about ownership. Mechanism
    through which it’s carried out can be decentralized → no conflict
    between ownership and control rights and how the work is organized
  - **Unger:** Think again of the metaphor of wartime production:
    government says stop making cars, we need tanks → provides help,
    puts them in touch with people, but all it wants is the tanks
  - Need to invent the institutional machinery of competitive
    experimentalism. The public initiative should not be seen as a
    suppression of that
  - Logic of the market is the logic of an organized experimental
    anarchy – we want more of that
  - Need initiative by the state to help us have more of it

## The relation between labor and capital as a context for reshaping the market order

**Unger**

  - Critique of neoclassical theory of firm leads to different options
    that are all unsatisfactory
      - Business roundtable (social responsibility) → place evaluation
        of “social direction” in hands of managerial elite
          - In practice: genuflect to political correctness of the day,
            reinforce whatever the current platitudes are. Why do we
            want this?
          - Harvard Business School motto: “Make profit with a
            conscience.” Would rather they just make profit and leave
            conscience to the public
      - Capital-intensive parts of economy: workers and employers have
        common interest against everyone else
      - Collaboration model: kind of corporatism in which firms do
        everything together with the state
          - Normal point of departure: as a condition for receiving
            corporate charter, the corporation must obey whatever is
            established by law
          - Law determines social direction and conditions of corporate
            activity
          - To describe it as “regulatory policy” trivializes it

**Rodrik**

  - Skeptical of social responsibility model, but two practical
    advantages:
      - Only one of four strategies that we’ve seen progress on
          - Large firms are doing something with practical effects
      - Rebecca Henderson at HBS one of the strongest proponents
          - She says this is not an alternative to the government or the
            law
          - Makes them more likely to be willing participants in
            government-led approaches
  - When labor has sense of ownership, participation, good things
    follow: satisfaction, productivity, technology adoption that is more
    cognizant of interests of labor
  - Law cannot specifically say what wage rate gig workers doing MTurk
    in this industry in that region should get, other complicated issues
    about employment standards
      - How do those get determined?

**Unger**

  - Law can say: you can have flexible contracts, but you have to pay
    them what you would otherwise
      - Courts and jurists develop series of standards and criteria
      - Law doesn’t determine details, it sets a direction
  - If we listen to business school, we always have the pietistic
    prevail over the transformative

**Rodrik**

  - Need flexibility in policy that the law cannot provide

Q: Do we think legal institutions are less prone to capture? In U.S.,
laws like right-to-work being used against workers.

**Unger**

  - That’s the general problem of politics. Law is not part of the
    institutions
  - 100% of the institutions are manifest in legal detail; they come
    from struggle in society over the arrangements
  - We prefer this struggle over subcontracting part of democratic power
    to a group such as the managerial elite
  - If there’s capture, the solution is more democracy
  - Can’t hedge against politics. Politics is fate
      - Either you give the power to the people and recognize that they
        may make mistakes
      - Or you give power to custodians
  - In the US, American liberals tried to sneak program through federal
    judiciary
      - What always happens: the empire strikes back
  - In terms of custodians, the managers are at the bottom of the moral
    hierarchy

**Rodrik**

  - Corporate social responsibility is partly due to abdication of
    national governments
  - Firms might rather know what the rules are than have to voluntarily
    participate
  - We have some international examples, but most of the action needs to
    happen at the national level

**Unger**

  - Emphasize the labor force and the nature of free labor in the
    contemporary economy, rather than the firm and its responsibility
  - 2 connections to general themes:
    1.  Linked to insular/inclusive knowledge economy
          - Technologically-provoked unemployment (automation discourse)
              - Take position that technological evolution is
                underdetermined → choice between technology replacing
                vs. augmenting labor
          - Historically, organization of labor within firms preceded by
            “putting-out system”
              - Now we see a new putting-out system
              - What we consider the “natural” way of organizing labor
                might turn out to be just an interlude between two
                putting-out systems
              - Increasing part of labor force consigned to precarious
                employment – can’t allow “flexibility” to serve as
                pretext for precarity
    2.  Alternative institutional forms of market economy:
          - Best thing is not to regulate, or compensate after the fact
            but to change it, in 3 domains:
            1.  Organization of production, relation of
                backwards/advanced parts
            2.  Relation of finance to economy
            3.  Relation of labor to capital

*Short-term program*

  - Proximate objective: increase chances that labor will be organized
    in a way that supports broad-based rise in productivity
  - Ulterior objective: enhance economic freedom, agency
  - Marx: most important feature of capitalism is that labor can be
    bought and sold
      - Is this the way things have to be?
  - Establish policies and arrangements that increase likelihood that
    technology evolves in a way that augments rather than replaces
    labor. 3 categories of actions:
    1.  Ways in which state can exemplify, encourage, mandate productive
        solutions that augment labor
          - Direct government action in areas such as defense technology
          - Fiscal and regulatory policy
    2.  Industrial policy: attempt to uplift retrograde firms to bring
        them closer to frontier; assist autonomous economic agents →
        transform into technologically-equipped artisans
    3.  Empower labor (by law) to have more access to advanced part of
        production, more power within advanced part of production
  - Legal regime of organization of labor. 2 main sectors:
    1.  Parts of economy with stable employment
          - What can or should the labor law regime be? 2 regimes:
            1.  Collective bargaining that prevails in North Atlantic,
                developed to redress radical inequality of bargaining
                power in employment context. 2 principles: (1) decision
                to unionize is voluntary, (2) unions are independent
                from state
            2.  Corporatist regime that predominates in Latin America.
                Originally developed in fascist Italy, adopted by
                leftist regimes in Latin America. 2 principles: (1)
                everyone automatically unionized, (2) union structure
                under direction of state, typically through Ministry of
                Labor
          - Despite suspect origins, corporatist regime has 3
            advantages:
            1.  Unionization is automatic. A “gift of the law.” Struggle
                of workers is not whether to unionize, but what to do
                with union power
            2.  Solidaristic tilt: less likely that union system
                reflects and reinforces underlying inequalities of
                production system
            3.  Favors claims that are more than economistic (i.e. wages
                and benefits) – has an institutional and political
                dynamic
          - Unacceptable vice: subordination of union movement to the
            state
          - Solution? Hybrid regime:
              - From corporatist regime, take automatic unionization
              - From collective bargaining, take freedom of union from
                the state
    2.  Unstable/precarious employment. 2 discourses:
        1.  Traditional labor discourse predicated on collective
            bargaining/corporatist regimes, wants to outlaw unstable
            employment as circumvention of labor laws. 2 defects:
            1.  Can’t turn back the clock and suppress new practices of
                production by decree
            2.  Serves interest of organized minority against
                disorganized majority
        2.  Neoliberal discourse preaches radical flexibility
              - Erode rights of workers and throw them into radical
                insecurity
    <!-- end list -->
      - Should distinguish flexibility (unavoidable or desirable) from
        radical economic insecurity
      - Need a new legal regime for unstable employment
          - These workers should be organized and represented
          - Legal principle of price neutrality: unstable employment
            remunerated at level at which they would be remunerated in
            stable employment
          - One point of departure: Scandinavian system of labor rights
            and social rights that are universally portable

*Long-term program*

  - Economic freedom becomes a central aim. 3 aspirations:
    1.  No human should be condemned to do work that can be done by a
        machine
          - Reserve our time for the not yet repeatable
          - Machines don’t have imagination
          - Create condition for our partnership with machines
          - This is the opposite of traditional forms of production:
            worker worked as if he were a machine
              - We want the opposite, but it’s unlikely as long as wage
                labor becomes predominant form of free work
    2.  Character of free labor. 3 main forms: wage labor,
        self-employment, cooperation
          - Liberals and socialists up to middle of the 19th century
            thought that economically dependent wage labor is a inferior
            and transitive form of free labor that would give way over
            time to self-employment and cooperation
              - Everyone believed this, not just Marx. Lincoln, John
                Stuart Mill
              - End of 19th century → predominance of wage labor came to
                seem natural and necessary
              - How do we implement this idea in contemporary economy?
              - Idea ran into problem of scale in 19th century
    3.  Need innovations in property regime
          - Develop range of ways in which economic agents can have
            decentralized access to productive resources and
            opportunities
          - Property is a bundle of powers that can be disassembled,
            components vested in different stakeholders → superimposed
            claims on same productive resource
              - Ex: productive resources vested in decentralized funds,
                use auctioned off to those groups who can offer highest
                rate of return (temporarily)
              - Alternative systems of property and contract coexisting
                experimentally within same market order

*Philosophical remark*

  - The premise of this set of ideas is that we can aspire to have
    freedom in the economy, not just freedom from the economy
  - Marx and Keynes believed we were on the verge of overcoming
    scarcity, and in the world beyond we could escape hateful burden of
    work and enjoy “private sublimities”
      - Both of these are false. We are not about to overcome scarcity
      - Also, not true that work is just a hateful burden
          - Under the knowledge economy, if we heighten trust and make
            work approximate the activity of imagining and producing,
            work can cease to be a hateful burden. But for whom?

**Rodrik**

  - Agree on wage neutrality: unstable workers → same conditions as in
    organized labor force. There should not be a dualism in structure of
    employment
      - In the taxi industry, avoid “Uberization” of workforce

**Unger**

  - Corporatist labor law regimes: Unions negotiate on behalf of large
    categories of workers sector by sector

**Rodrik**

  - Advantage of corporatism: universality
  - Labor power, even in capital intensive parts of production (Amazons
    and Googles), might have valuable spillovers? RMU disagrees
  - New technologies can augment labor directly or indirectly:
      - Technology that gives nurses skills to do what doctors do is a
        direct augmentation of nurses’ labor
      - Alternative: increase number of tasks that need to be performed
          - New technology enables teachers to discern learning styles
            of different students and provide customized education in a
            highly differentiated way
          - Increases the tasks that teachers can do – indirect
            augmentation of labor
      - How do we change incentives to do both of these things?

**Unger**

  - Up to now, thought of this as race between human and machine
    (i.e. who’s better at playing chess?)
      - In certain respects, machines are more powerful
      - But we have a different hierarchy in the direction of
        imagination
      - Subsume actual under range of transformative variation
      - We can discover before we’ve made sense of something, in
        violation of our own methods and presuppositions, and then
        develop methods to make sense of them retrospectively
      - Enhances hope of partnership between human and machine
  - Creation of breakthroughs depends on sifting through alternatives:
    experimentation
      - Humans have to do it through time. Experimentalism requires
        time, but it’s our scarcest resource
      - Machine does it through computational power, which can be almost
        instantaneous
      - If machines can help us deal with our scarcest resource, time,
        they can be immense ally in our liberation

# Globalization and alternative globalizations: the international counterpart to these national debates

**Rodrik**

  - William Jennings Bryan speech at DNC, 1896: “You shall not crucify
    mankind upon a cross of gold”
      - Gold standard was target of late 19th century American populists
      - Led by farmers angry at unification of commodity markets at
        moment of price deflation → prices of agricultural products
        coming down
      - Relatively scarce gold supplies → nominal interest rates high,
        even higher real interest rate, given deflation
      - This was a consequence of “tight money” – no freedom to increase
        money supply, since it was linked to supply of gold
      - Backlash against financiers and bankers in Northeast seen as
        proponents of these policies
          - Analog to today: globalization imposing strict constraints
            on conduct of economic policy at home which harmed sectors
            of economy (here, farmers) → political expression
  - Alternative globalizations
      - We take for granted a particular type of economic globalization:
        IMF, WTO, global supply chains
      - All globalizations run on rules (explicit) and norms
        (internalized) – don’t spontaneously arise from technology
          - Majority of countries that have embraced financial
            globalization (open capital markets) because they think
            that’s what good behavior is, not because they’re
            following rules
          - Who writes the rules? Whose preferences are privileged?
      - Could have globalization targeted at preventing/mitigating
        pandemics, with WHO at the center
          - Warning system, research budget for pandemics, prevention of
            export controls on medical equipment, regulated border
            closures…
      - Another alternative: Globalization targeted at slowing down
        climate change
          - Globally binding emission quotas, research budget for
            renewable energy, financing for transition to green energy
      - Globalization focused on human development and empowerment
      - Alternative forms of economic globalization, too
          - Which flows should be liberalized? Trade, finance, labor?
          - Should rules reach behind borders? In which areas?
              - Subsidies, industrial policies, emissions, tax regimes
          - Ex: Gold standard included aspiration to labor mobility, but
            not Bretton Woods or post-1990s hyperglobalization
          - Ex: Gold standard and post-1990s regime included restraints
            on domestic policies, but not Bretton Woods
  - Tensions between democracy and economic globalization
      - Trilemma: choose two of national sovereignty,
        hyperglobalization, mass politics
      - Hyperglobalization = absence of transaction costs on
        cross-border trade and finance
          - No restrictions on goods, services, assets at the border
          - Harmonize monetary, legal, regulatory regimes
          - Credibly pre-commit not to deviate from these regimes
      - Differences in national institutional arrangements create
        cross-border transaction costs and impede globalization
      - Hyperglobalization runs on the logic of arbitrage → undermines
        differences in regulations and social models
          - More advanced labor standards? Firms will shift production
            to jurisdictions with lower labor standards
          - More capital market regulations? Banks go to locations where
            regulations are lax and export products
          - More progressive income tax? Wealthy individuals and
            corporations will move to lower-tax jurisdiction but do
            business in your market
      - Tensions are more manageable when economic integration is
        limited (GATT) or regulatory differences are small (US states)
      - What kind of a state does hyperglobalization require?
          - Provide property rights, contract enforcement, monetary
            stability
          - No costs on free flow of goods or capital
              - Sacrifice other objectives to this
          - Problematic for democratic regimes, since we want the
            possibility of divergent policies/institutional arrangements
      - Democratic delegation: democratic rule can be constrained
        without creating undemocratic outcomes
          - Limit power of special interests
          - Enhance quality of democratic deliberation
          - Principle applies to international commitments, too
      - But there’s a difference between logic of hyperglobalization
        (justify any rules that restrict domestic autonomy to minimize
        transaction costs) and democracy-enhancing globalization (impose
        mostly procedural norms that enhance deliberation)
      - Gold standard: hyperglobalization and national sovereignty,
        seems incompatible with mass politics
          - Rules too strict for a representative system to maintain?
      - Bretton Woods: maximize democratic legitimacy at home –
        Keynesian macro policies + welfare state + economic
        restructuring
          - Some sectors left out of international agreements
          - When international trade threatened to overwhelm social
            bargains (1970s: exports from newly industrialized countries
            affect low-income sectors in advanced economics) → carve out
            exceptions to give advanced countries room
          - Explicitly incomplete globalization
      - Hyperglobalization: Post-1990s, WTO + financial globalization
          - Due to failure of legitimacy where rules went too far
            (trade) – too far from democratic deliberation
          - And failure of regulation where they didn’t go far enough
            (finance)
      - Another alternative: “global governance,” do away with national
        sovereignty entirely
          - “Quasi-federalism” at the global level
          - Ideal of the European Union
  - Outlines of a desirable form of economic globalization
      - Benefits to all rather than a few
      - Enforce rules for global public goods
      - Leaves space for institutional diversity across nations

**Unger**

  - Application of idea of hyperglobalization to labor mobility: seems
    like what DR and international technocracy mean by
    “hyperglobalization” is not meant to include radical advance in
    mobility of labor
  - Difference between mobility of capital/goods and labor is very
    significant

**Rodrik**

  - Yes, post-1990s globalization has not included labor markets
  - But don’t want to simply extend hyperglobalization to labor
  - Want more balanced tradeoff between pushing for gains from trade and
    maintaining institutional diversity
      - In the case of labor, would require us to move further towards
        globalization
      - But for goods and capital, move back

**Unger**

  - One direction: there should be a radically different treatment of
    goods/capital and labor
  - Other direction: they should achieve freedom together in small,
    cumulative steps
  - This radical difference in direction is concealed under label
    “hyperglobalization”

**Rodrik**

  - Is the ultimate goal complete mobility? That would be
    hyperglobalization
  - My view: long-term tradeoff between gains from trade and gains from
    institutional diversity
      - This always establishes a limit to how much globalization we can
        have

**Unger**

  - Movement of things and money is sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful
  - Movement of people is sacrosanct: significance transcends the merely
    economic realm
      - But cannot be established instantaneously, radically
  - Can’t put this on a spectrum of more or less globalization
  - Radical capital mobility is dangerous: suppresses possibility of
    national development
  - Paradox in mainline economic theory: division of world into
    sovereign states is an accident, an embarrassment – why divide the
    world at all? Just creates transaction costs
      - Integrated world equilibrium is just a fantasy
      - Division of world into states is basis of trade theory
      - Why is the world divided? Because we value difference – for
        moral and political reasons, as well as economic benefits

**Rodrik**

  - Challenge idea that economics has no explanation for division of
    rules in sovereign units
  - Local public goods: different communities have different preferences
    → want different types of institutional arrangements
  - Idea of gains from trade rooted in comparative advantage; this
    theory applies to why we want different nation-states
  - But this theory doesn’t explain why we have existing structure of
    nation-states

**Unger**

  - Local public goods are a thin, impoverished basis for understanding
    value of nations
  - More fundamental basis: fecundity of method of competitive selection
    depends on richness of material from which method selects (analog to
    Darwin)
  - Not a provincial accident of people having different preferences in
    different places
  - Difference has to be *created* – we don’t want just the difference
    that arises spontaneously
  - Another point: an assumption of established discourse about
    hyperglobalization is that more openness requires more harmonization
    (legal and institutional similarity) and fewer transaction costs
      - This is a fundamental mistake
      - History of economics and law show that many earlier experiments
        in globalization have pushed extent to which openness and trade
        is compatible with underlying legal and institutional difference
      - GATT characterized by legal and institutional minimalism
          - Prior history of same thing: lex mercatoria (merchant law)
            in European history
          - Whole point of international commercial law was to reconcile
            increasing trade with underlying legal and institutional
            diversity
      - The impulse of this discourse of harmonization and exaggerated
        significance of transaction costs is to connect openness with
        legal and institutional similarity

**Rodrik**

  - How would we measure globalization/openness? Two different ways:
      - Quantities of flows. Lot of globalization because lot of trade,
        lot of investment crossing borders
      - Size of the barriers: Are there costs to goods/services/people
        moving across borders
  - These can move in different directions. Can have barriers that are
    relatively high (GATT regime, Middle Ages) – but still have a lot of
    flows because existing barriers enable countries to manage countries
    better, creating more hospitable environment for the flows
      - Bretton Woods/GATT regime: expansion in trade. Not primarily
        because we reduced transaction costs; bulk of expansion because
        countries individually prospered → ended up trading more with
        each other
  - Differences are definitionally barriers
      - People get around these barriers by costly evasion – bypassing
        local sovereignty, etc.

**Unger**

  - Costs of differences are subsidiary to larger point: under
    established discourse which wants to associate openness with absence
    of difference, friends of difference are enemies of openness
  - There isn’t a single spectrum of tradeoffs
  - To what extent can we reconcile openness with underlying
    institutional difference is an empirical question. We can’t answer a
    priori

**Rodrik**

  - Magnitude of transaction costs is empirical. But whether differences
    do indeed impose transaction costs can be answered a priori
  - Normatively appropriate benchmark is the barriers, not the volume

Q: Why shouldn’t we make global governance a goal? Is harmonization of
human rights part of hyperglobalization?

**Rodrik**

  - Some areas where it’s easier to establish global norms, e.g. human
    rights
  - Appropriately hyper-global regime (along with climate change, global
    health)
  - These are domains of global public goods
  - Not sure the same applies to labor. This economic obligation doesn’t
    rise to the same level
      - Global set of rules creating completely free labor markets is
        maybe not desirable

**Unger**

  - We want world trade system to be based on free labor
  - One the one hand, different countries have to be able to compete on
    basis of different returns to labor
      - Don’t want this to result in suppression of freedom of labor

Q: Post-1990 system hasn’t enhanced labor mobility, but not for lack of
trying (consensus on economic benefits of immigration).

**Rodrik**

  - Business interests not successful at liberalizing immigration
      - Have not been as organized, though, compared to their efforts in
        IP, banking/financial regulation
      - Businesses can feel direct benefits in, ex: liberalization of H1
        visas
      - Not organized where gains are more diffuse – low-skill labor
  - To get things done, need to use ideas and narratives, too
      - “Trade-related intellectual property rights” (TRIPS) –
        economists did not want this, but the narrative (from Big
        Pharma) gave their cause legitimacy
      - We can provide counter-narratives

Q: To what extent can environmental and health globalizations be
separated from economic integration?

**Rodrik**

  - Could envisage world where every economy is independent (autarky)
    but climate is still a global public good
  - How do we impose rules on carbon taxes? Can just charge countries
    through body like UN. Doesn’t mean they have to trade

# The struggle over the shape of the market order and the contest over ways of thinking: the role of economics and of its possible reorientation

**Unger**

  - Begin with background theme: alternative futures of economics
    itself. Where will we get the ideas we need to think about the
    problems we have been addressing?
  - This is where he and DR fundamentally disagree. DR sees nothing
    fundamentally wrong with established economics
      - RMU recognizes economics is the best established of social
        sciences
      - Forces on us clarity, especially about tradeoffs and constraints
      - But it’s not enough
  - Difficult to address nature of limitations/alternative directions
    because:
      - Confusion of relation of subject matter to method
          - Economics is not study of the economy; it’s the study of a
            method pioneered by marginalist theoreticians of end of 19th
            century
          - Study of economy by another method (e.g.: Weber) is not
            regarded as economics
          - Study of something that has nothing to do with production
            and exchange might be regarded as economics because it
            deploys this method
      - Familiar criticisms (unrealistic assumptions about competition
        or rationality) are almost all uncomprehending → rightly
        dismissed
          - Arise from failure to understand character of method and its
            ambitions
          - These misleading criticisms crowd out the criticisms we need
      - Attempted heresies during course of evolution of mainline
        economics
          - Dialectic of these largely failed heresies suggests we have
            everything we need by way of intellectual diversity
      - If we arrive at conclusion that economics in present state is
        insufficient, then we have no alternative readily available
          - Absence of alternative dissuades us from pursuing criticism
            and reconstruction
  - Place problem of economics in narrative of modern social thought
      - Classical European social theory was a theory of structure –
        structures that exist in history, how they change, laws that
        govern their operation and transformation
      - Paradigm was Marx’s critique of English political economy
          - English economists represent as universal laws what are
            actually regularities of particular economic regime:
            capitalism
          - Regimes and structures are contingent and revisable
              - But this was circumscribed by classical social theory by
                a series of deterministic illusions
              - Thought there was a closed list of regimes, each an
                indivisible system, with a script governing their
                foreordained succession
              - Subsequent thought rebelled, but suppressed structural
                imagination altogether
      - Each social science has severed link between insight into actual
        and imagination of adjacent possible
          - They present as explanation what is a retrospective
            rationalization of established arrangements
      - Problems of economics are a variant on fundamental theme:
        suppression of structural imagination
  - Deal with main line of economics resulting from marginalist
    revolution, suggest alternative account of its limitations
      - Marginalists (Walras, Jevens, Menger) saw economy as set of
        connected markets
      - Viewed operation of markets from the standpoint of individual
        agents (methodological individualism) who the best available
        means to achieve their goals
          - Competitive selection under constraint of scarcity
      - Results of individual decisions are aggregated by the market and
        manifest in the system of relative prices
          - Prices reshaped at the margin by the last decision →
            “marginalism”
      - This approach to the economy had 2 fundamental motivations:
          - Cut through confusion about the relation between underlying
            value and price that had beset pre-marginalist, “classical”
            economics
          - Create form of economic science relatively invulnerable to
            empirical controversy and ideological conflict
      - At time of marginalist revolution, there were many alternative
        directions for economics:
          - Edgeworth’s program: economics as psychological and
            behavioral science
          - Alfred Marshall: develop economics by analogy to natural
            history (weather or tides) – context-bound, loose causal
            sequences
          - These have resurfaced, but never broken hegemony of approach
            that resulted from marginalist turn
  - What are the limitations of this economics? 4 main ones:
      - Relative dissociation of formal analysis from causal and
        empirical investigation
          - Less a causal science than a form of logic
          - In its purest form, it’s an analytic apparatus, innocent of
            factual stipulations and normative commitments but also of
            causal theories other than residual causal theories that
            could be inferred from simple scheme of means-ends
            rationality under constraint of scarcity
          - Marginalist theoreticians exploited affinity of that scheme
            to deductive reasoning
          - This affinity helps explain why this economics reveres
            mathematics, but almost all math deployed in economics is
            relatively primitive
              - Not because economists are incapable, but because higher
                mathematics is useless to their method
              - Only a relatively simple mathematics is needed to carry
                the work of this quasi-logical science in which
                means-ends scheme is the basis of analogy to syllogistic
                reasoning
          - Characteristic procedure of economists is development and
            substitution of models to explain a set of economic
            phenomena
              - If model doesn’t work, create another one
              - At no point does substitution of models jeopardize
                underlying theory, because theory at its heart is not a
                causal theory making empirical statements – it’s a
                logical scheme supporting deductive reasoning
              - Different from, e.g., Standard Model of particle physics
              - If Standard Model faced accumulating level of contrary
                empirical observation, there would be some attempt to
                “save” it by rearrangements among its propositions, or
                by context-bound qualifications, but would be swept
                aside
              - Can never happen in marginalist economics because
                there’s nothing in the elementary schema that anything
                that in the world could fundamentally impugn
          - This form of analytic invulnerability is an onus preventing
            dialectic of theory and discovery, of counterintuitive
            insight into workings of the world, condemning discipline to
            eternal infancy
              - But hasn’t economics become increasingly empirical?
                “Copious flesh hangs awkwardly from a frail skeleton”
              - Where does causal element come from? Needs to come from
                means-ends rationality or be imported from a different
                discipline – behavioral or neuroeconomics (developing
                what was earlier Edgeworth’s program)
              - Or developed on the spot – context-bound economics
      - Deficit of institutional imagination
          - Coexistence between 3 types of economics:
              - Pure economics: empty of institutional
                assumptions/commitments, exemplified by general
                equilibrium analysis
              - Fundamentalist economics: Hayek, associating abstract
                idea of market economy with contingent set of
                institutional and legal arrangements (contract,
                property)
              - Equivocating economics: macroeconomics, professes to
                study lawlike relations among large-scale aggregates
                against shadowy institutional background. Change in
                details of background matter, but because background is
                static, these details can be disregarded
          - To the extent this economics is rigorous, it is empty of
            institutional insight; to the extent it has institutional
            implications, it has them by virtue of equivocation and
            confusion
      - Lacking proper account of production
          - Before: theory of exchange and of production had same
            importance
          - Now: economics textbook chapter on production has almost
            nothing about what we would ordinarily call production
              - Almost everything is about factors of production and
                substitution, different forms of market organization
          - Reduction of production to shadowy extension of exchange
            made possible by a contingent feature of economies: in them,
            labor can be bought and sold (what Marx considered the most
            important feature of capitalism)
              - So production can be seen under lens of relative prices
      - Theory of competitive selection bereft of any account of how
        material from which the method selects is formed
          - Like if we had only Darwinian natural selection and not the
            part about genetic recombination
          - Fecundity of process depends on richness of material on
            which it operates
          - No account of economic life is acceptable if it’s missing
            that half
  - Address 2 largely halfhearted and failed attempts to break out of
    trajectory that marginalist revolution established
      - Development economics
          - Albert Herschmann: potential to represent alternative
            direction for economic theory, but pursued strategy of
            peaceful coexistence with dominant paradigm, eventually
            swept aside, reduced to series of context-dependent studies
              - Squandered opportunity to be point of departure for
                consequential intellectual rebellion
      - Keynesianism
          - Most successful economic apostate of 20th century, but a
            contained apostasy: insufficient to serve as basis for
            program of critique
          - Almost no institutional content – key variables all
            psychological: preference for liquidity, propensity to
            consume, long-term expectations
              - Tendency in English political economy of psychologism,
                prior to marginalism
              - Institutional observation limited to particular domains
                like stock market
          - Focus on demand side, rather than supply side
              - Can’t have alternative economics without comprehensive
                theory of breakthroughs on supply side and demand side
                (and relation between the two)
          - Theory of economic slumps was not a “general theory,” but
            one of a particular kind – characterized by hoarding,
            rigidity of wages, inadequate demand
              - Inadequacy manifest in difficulty we have applying it to
                recessions of present day: leverage, expansion of credit
                masking absence of property-owning democracy,
                concentration of wealth resulting in asset bubbles
                producing vulnerability that begins in finance, but
                compromises real economy
          - Caught in between theory of equilibrium at low level of
            employment (which American followers adopted) and permanent
            disequilibrium
          - Lesson in dangers of partial intellectual rebellion. 4
            stages:
              - Keynes focused on response to slump that he regarded as
                politically palatable: only focus on demand side
              - Year later, his follower Hicks developed IS-LM schema –
                formulaic reduction of his doctrine
              - American followers (led by Samuelson) reinterpreted,
                downsized theory into theory of fiscal and monetary
                policy for countercyclical management of economy
              - Labeled “macroeconomics” and placed alongside inherited
                body of theory (redubbed “microeconomics”)
              - Under headings like “microfoundations of
                macroeconomics,” economists observed everything new in
                this theory was unnecessary and could be inferred from
                microeconomic/marginalist theory
      - After all of this, we have no way of thinking structurally about
        the economy
          - Leftists embraced vulgar Keynesianism when they abandoned
            Marx
  - No alternative to a confrontation
      - Economics is useful, even indispensable as science of tradeoffs
        and constraints, friend of intellectual clarity and rigor
      - But it can’t bring us to the threshold of insight into
        structural alternatives
      - How to proceed? Most ambitious: a comprehensive theory. But this
        is the limiting case

**Rodrik**

  - This picture of what an alternative economics might look like is
    setting standards we can’t meet – possible advantages are outweighed
    by disadvantages
      - Mistakes RMU cited: those economists were looking for universal
        laws or a theory of history that also wants economics to do 
  - Economists have carved out useful function by performing a certain
    trick: study of a method, rather than study of the economy
      - “Thinking like an economist” has compelling power
      - Sometimes taken too far – economic imperialism
  - Main disagreement: what RMU is looking for is something universal to
    think about structural alternatives
      - But not job of economics to provide that
      - Smith and Marx had a particular view of what economic progress
        might look like
          - Universalist view ended up backfiring
  - Approach is immune to challenge? True that if particular model is
    challenged, it’s not the way of thinking that’s challenged, it’s the
    model
  - Economics is different than natural sciences because in principle
    there is an infinite variety of social reality to describe – no
    universal constants
      - Cause and effect relationship is always contingent in a
        potentially infinite number of ways
      - How can something so indeterminate be useful?
          - Ex: How would minimum wages work? Depends on competitive
            equilibrium vs. monopsony. It depends, but we know what it
            depends on, and we can empirically check which model is
            relevant
  - Economics has moved from programmatic vision (Smith, Marx) to a
    discipline – a deductive, analytical tool
      - Can distinguish analytical thinking from normative/ideological
        baggage
      - Normative substance needs to come from elsewhere
          - Chicago school libertarians: combined tools with normative
            judgements of inequality and practical view of government as
            corrupt
          - Krugman-type liberals: same tools, combine with different
            normative judgements on inequality and more hopeful view of
            government
  - Failings of economics:
      - Mistake model for reality
      - Categorical preference for certain axioms (e.g. rationality)
      - Preference for problems that are amenable to these tools
      - Implicit political-economy theorizing in policy discussions
          - Especially in focus on efficiency as only way to evaluate
            policies
  - What RMU calls a shortcoming is an advantage – don’t want economists
    to lay claim to universal framework for thinking about structural
    alternatives

**Unger**

  - Task of theory is to provide insight into transformation
      - To understand something is to understand what it can become
  - If we use models to represent established economic phenomena, how do
    we understand how they change?
      - In post-marginalist tradition, theory is doing something else:
        exempting itself from insight into transformation and providing
        supposedly neutral analytical framework
      - Role that would be theory’s is played by “art”
          - “Intuition for model selection”
          - This shouldn’t exempt us from having a view on
            transformation
  - Criticize invocation of intellectual modesty: “someone else will
    deal with structural matters”
      - In current day, central space of social theory and philosophy is
        vacant
      - Real debate happens in economics and law
      - Both barred themselves against responsibility of transformative
        insight
          - Economics as a result of history of marginalism
          - Law because it’s representing system of idealized policies
            and principles
      - Both disciplines are misdirected – but we say someone else will
        do this work of imagining alternatives
          - “Someone else” has to be us

Q: A lot of legal thinking based on categorical morality. Economic
thinking based on consequentialism: individual utility maximization, or
social welfare. Is there a tension? How do we reform economic models?

**Unger**

  - Diminishing marginal returns is pretty close to a law in economic
    thinking
      - If we could loosen or reverse this, we would have potential for
        exponential growth
      - If we think of innovation as functionally equivalent to input
        and it’s continuous rather than episodic, then we have potential
        to escape diminishing marginal returns
  - No rich background of conversations about transformation of
    structure
  - Phillips Curve stops working → something changed in institutional
    background → no way of thinking about relation between economic
    phenomena and institutional background. Another way we might begin
  - We don’t have to treat this as prerogative of genius
  - Can’t just enrich and contextualize economics. Look to natural
    science – rich set of causal conjectures and a physical or social
    conception of how something transforms
      - Math may or may not be useful
      - But not toy mathematics that is simply the adornment of
        deductive reasoning
          - Sterile as methodological basis for thinking about
            transformation

# Conclusions: Rethinking political economy

**Rodrik**

  - Antecedent model: New Deal/welfare state, settlement between working
    class (accumulated through Industrial Revolution) and
    business/financial elites
      - Significant social insurance
      - Job security through institutionalized labor markets (trade
        unions, collective bargaining)
      - Regulated finance
      - Mass production
      - Keynesian macroeconomic management – activist fiscal, monetary
        policy targeting stabilization of aggregate demand
      - “Thin” globalization: Bretton Woods and IMF = capital controls,
        GATT system
  - Collapse of this model:
      - Technological change with unequal rewards
      - Hyperglobalization
      - Financial globalization: free flow of short-term capital
      - Deinstitutionalization of labor markets
      - Deindustrialization (premature in low- and middle-income
        countries)
      - Neoliberal narrative on macroeconomic management: downplayed
        active management, emphasized markets, austerity
  - Empirically: decline of middle-class share of income; employment
    prospects and wage of middle class has suffered most (worldwide)
  - Three interconnected challenges:
      - Inclusion: how do we ensure those who have been excluded from
        advanced technologies are reincorporated?
      - Growth: address slowdown of productivity growth in advanced
        countries, premature deindustrialization in developing countries
      - (Political: authoritarianism, personalistic strong-man politics)
  - Common root: scarcity of productive, stable middle-class jobs
  - Remedies?
      - New social contract based on new “industrial” policy
          - Increase supply of good jobs
          - Redirect innovation in labor-friendly direction
      - State strong enough to achieve inclusive growth, but not strong
        enough to smother pluralism
      - Balanced globalization. Encourage pluralism, but focus on:
          - Global public goods (pandemics, climate change)
          - Beggar-thy-neighbor policies (global tax havens)
          - Areas with large economic gains (labor mobility)

**Unger**

  - Transition in most advanced practice of production: traditional mass
    production to knowledge economy
      - Smith and Marx understood that best way to understand
        alternative futures is to look to most advanced practice
      - Transition has produced a disappointment and a danger:
          - Appears as series of exclusive fringes
          - Leads to economic stagnation, aggravation of inequality
      - How do we deepen and disseminate the most advanced practice?
  - Broader focus: situation and sequel to last major moment of
    institutional and ideological refoundation – the social
    democratic/social liberal settlement developed after WWII
      - In US: New Deal welfare state
      - Regulation, attenuate inequality retrospectively
        (tax-and-transfer), countercyclical management
      - Most important problems can’t be addressed within the limits of
        this compromise
  - 3 problems in political economy:
      - Relation of backward to advanced practices of production
      - Relation of labor to capital
      - Relation of finance to production
  - Social cohesion: money transfers organized by state against
    background of ethnic homogeneity
      - As homogeneity fades, inadequacy of money as social cement is
        exposed
  - Under arrangement of weak democracies, change continues to depend on
    crisis
      - No trauma, no transformation
      - Need form of democratic politics that diminishes dependence of
        change on crisis
  - Methods: we have a problem in contemporary thought with the
    discussion of structural discontinuity, structural alternatives
      - Classical thought had structural vision which was corrupted by
        various forms of determinism (Marxism)
      - Contemporary social sciences: deficient in structural
        imagination
      - Embarrassment in programmatic arguments: feasible but trivial
        vs. interesting but utopian → everything proposed likely to be
        dismissed as trivial or utopian
          - Fall back on bastardized criterion of political realism:
            proximity to the existent
          - False dilemma threatens to inhibit the programmatic ambition
  - Hope: past great thinkers had generous vision of unrealized human
    opportunity motivating search for transformation
      - This whole course is a bet on the marriage of insight to hope
  - The only democracies we have are weak and low-energy
      - Based on low level of people’s engagement in political life
      - Awaken only when there’s trouble
  - Not persistent tests of established structure
  - Alternatives: authoritarian vanguards that claim to speak in name of
    collective interest, but hold this collective interest ransom to
    their dogmas
  - Transform weak democracies into strong democracies: depends on
    institutional innovations in the form of democratic politics
      - Increase level, tempo of politics
  - Basic schema of ideological controversy: state against the market
    (more of one or the other, or synthesis of market and state)
      - Different conception of ideological contest: alternative
        institutional form of the market, independent civil society
  - World is restless under dictatorship of no alternatives
